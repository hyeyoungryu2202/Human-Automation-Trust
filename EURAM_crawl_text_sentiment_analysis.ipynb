      "['\\r\\n                The points they gave me after every booking stayed pending, and never materialised.Also the Nectar points were not added after I paid for my holidays booked through Expedia. And their reason was I didn\\'t add my Nectar number. Which I did on every booking.I will not used Expedia again.J. Darmo\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I’ve used Expedia many times to book travel. They are great as long as you don’t have to make any changes to your booking. However, if you need to make any changes or modifications, they are horrible.  We booked a flight that was cancelled so we had to reschedule. Gave them a call and told them which flight we wanted and they said we should hear back from them in 48-72 hours when the change has been made. Didn’t hear from them. Called again and was told they would confirm in 48-72 hrs. Didn’t hear from them. With the power of social media, and after a bad tweet, they contacted me to help me with the problem. By this time, we couldn’t get on the flight we wanted and was waitlisted. We decided to call the airline directly ourselves and they said that there was still seats on the flight and there was still seats being sold on the Expedia website. They told us that if we were able to get through to the airline ourselves then we should just book with them. I’m almost certain that this is what we pay them to do. However, because we booked through Expedia, the airline couldn’t do anything.  We were told by Expedia that they could only contact the airline through email. In a world where technology has advanced so much, how is it that email is the only way for communication?  Expedia ended up booking us on a flight that we didn’t want and left us no choice but to take it. They will do anything to not issue you a refund. Their customer service is terrible and I will never book through them again\\r\\n            \\r\\n                This is the worst experience I\\'ve got ever. I booked this hotel through expedia around 5:30pm, then due to my personal reason I tried to cancel on 7pm. Since I booked it through expedia, obviously I called expedia to help cancel this order. The service guy accepted my request, and said there might be some charges deductible, I said since it\\'s my reason I have no problem to bear some costs. Then he asked me on line to wait for result. After 15-20mintues online waiting, he said the hotel disagreed to refund me, but would continue to charge me full. I said now it\\'s only 7pm, and obviously I would not go to hotel for check in, why should I be charged for full amount? Then he suggested me to contact hotel directly. I said no, because I trust expedia, and I take myself as a customer of expedia, and I paid to expedia directly, why should I contact any other third party. Finally he said he will try tomorrow and give me updates, then there was no udpates until today. And the full amount charged next day from my credit card.I\\'m ok with this $143, cannot hurt me, but I really feel disappointed about expedia. After this matter, I cannot see any value of expedia. Why should I use expedia to book hotels? Expedia should get close cooperation with all partners including this small hotel. But from this matter, I cannot see the professional services or solutions on how to make its customer satisfied. So farewell expedia, you sucks!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Booked hotel and rental care together to get best deal.  Chose the only car rental vendor that Expedia said had car and counter IN the airport.  Location drove my decision making as my husband is blind and luggage and shuttles make for difficult travel.  Learned on arrival that San Diego has NO counters or cars in airport. Expedia was sloppy and Economy rental is shady.  I pre-paid for insurance and vehicle.  In addition to my pre pay the vender required a very large hold on a card. In addition to the rental fee.  we had issues with this and after discussion with manager it was decided that Economy would refund our money and we would be free to make other plans.  I then learned that my pre-payment was never in the venders hands but still with Expedia.  Manager said I Do not have your money until rental complete and returned i will cancel and you will have to deal with Expedia to get your $.  His nasty grin should have been my first clue that my trouble had just begun! What a disaster speaking to “customer service” outside the US and spent 3.5 hours and a full week before I could get confirmation that they “plan to submit” request for refund.  It was not until I took to Facebook that I got the promise of a refund over a week after we were to start vacation.  There was no reason to make this process difficult!  I can think nothing but that the difficulty is built into their process. Never Again!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Where to even begin. I have been a frequent traveller for years, up until the last few months I thought Expedia was a good idea. Here are issues that I believe are scams, terrible customer service, and unacceptable:1. Wait time to receive any assistance. In total I have spent upwards of 9 hours on hold waiting for assistance in the span of two weeks, after the Airline kept changing my flights and I had to call to reselect a better flight. I had to ask to be transferred to a different agent a couple of times when they don\\'t understand what is going on (when the flight is changed you have the option to re-select a better flight due to the change at no charge. Some agents don\\'t even know that and try to charge you).2. Advertise false information. a) I rented a car, and when I got to the airport I found out the location I selected wasn\\'t in the airport (My fault for not paying attention even though when booking I clicked that I wanted airport location). I went on Expedia and it said I could cancel with no cost. So I did. THEN I get home and I still got charged and Expedia says \"well we don\\'t charge you a cancellation, but the car rental company does\". That\\'s unbelievable.

Yesterday about 36 hours before I started out, an e-mail from them, my hotel is closed for rennovations. ONLY 36 hours before travel. Why didn\\'t they know earlier? i discussed accom alternatives and nothing suitable. i found on-line that I could have a full refund. Now although I booked a flight and hotel package with them, somehow the flight payment is taken separately and Thomas Cook now also charge you extra for 1 suitcase £25.00 each way. I spoke to 9 different Expedia staff for around 3-4 hours including their waiting time to get it all cancelled. The hotel dept said to cancel the flight first with the flight dept and the flight dept said the other way round. Being put on hold for almost 1 hr, then 33 mins, asking to speak to a manager 4 times, didn\\'t get one, being cut off four times although I do have a weak signal where I live. If you come across this ask for a coupon for hours of convenience. I have a good one so will have to use them again once more only. this is WITHOUT PREJUDICE. It was OUTRAGEOUS that they took almost 2 hours to refund my flight. Go well.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I wish I had read the reviews before I booked a hotel for a week.  This company is truly awful, and they are liars.  They say they make it easy to cancel or change your plans but that is NOT true by any stretch of the imagination.  I didn\\'t even want to cancel, I just wanted to push my date back one night. It took over THREE hours on the phone with someone who didn\\'t speak understandable English (no offense but it\\'s true), only to be told it would be done, except the next day I got an email from them saying oh sorry but the hotel wouldn\\'t allow it so we are going to charge you full price. I got to the hotel and they were confused, told me they would issue a refund of course! Except the refund was NEVER received because they had to issue it to Expedia who then POCKETED MY REFUND.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                purchased a one day tour for 5 people that included private tour guide, tuk tuk transportation 1 day admission to temple and elephant ride. tour guide was 2 hours late did not receive admission (ended up paying additional 185 for that) did not receive elephant ride. hotel helped us get tour guide (he was 2 hours late). told tour guide that admission and elelphant ride was included in tour price. he called the tour company (which did not speak english) they said no. we couldn\\'t call expedia as we had no phone to call the u.s.) when we returned to u.s. i immediately called expedia. said they could not call indochina tours because they did not speak english. then they said the tour was already over so they couldn\\'t help. all in all the whole experience with expedia and indochina tours was very disappointing. Expedia offered zero help even to help us get in touch with the tour company.  I more than likely will not use them again. they were our middle man to help us with a tour that was booked through them and they offered nothing to help us. I would not recommend them and if you do need a tour go through the hotel. very disappointed.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                use them alot great\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I am very disappointed by the service received at Expedia. I had two back to back flight cancellations and did not receive any notifications from Expedia, thus forced to stay 12 hours at the airport, and pay triple the amount to book through a different agency in order to get a flight out. I am entitled to a full refund by the flight agency and have been on hold for 3 hours+, and have still not received any compensation. I will never use Expedia again for my travel bookings.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                The flight booking went perfectly smoothly. We\\'d booked a flight and hotel bundle, and we got to the hotel with our reservation intact. The problem was, Expedia categorised people above 18 as adults while the hotel considered adults to be above 12 years old, which is why they wanted to charge us extra upon our arrival. After demanding we speak to the manager and have him contact Expedia to deal with the discrepancy, they gave in and realized there was some sort of mistake. My only complaint is that Expedia and some of the hotels it\\'s partnered up with dont have the same idea about adult age and therefore prices are different.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I cannot believe after all of these years using this company exclusively that they sold me an insurance policy that actually didn\\'t allow me to cancel a flight 10 days in advance! I went thru a very lengthy process for nothing. I will never use this service again! With so many other companies offeriing similar services, I now know where not to go! Your affiliates are not trustworthy and you stink for not doing something about it!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Called to cancel a flight reservation I had previously made, the change was due to an impending snow storm, and we needed to get our new seats together.  When I called their customer service line, I was eventually (after two minutes of failing to navigate the voice prompts to go straight to a customer service agent) connected to an agent (Alex) in the Philippines who seemed to take an extra-ordinary amount of time (as though it were part of their script) to look up the JetBlue policy on change/cancellation.  It actually took him more than 5 minutes to look this up, which should have been available in seconds.  I prompted him several times during that 5 minutes, and he kept telling me he was still looking it up.  Once he did, he informed me that they only offered an Expedia credit, that it had to be used within 1 year and that it had to be used with the same airline and for the same person (I purchased the ticked with a credit card for another person).  While I still asked him to cancel the flight, I asked to speak to a supervisor about how the credit after the change fee was issued.  He refused to cancel the flight, and told me that I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes to speak to a supervisor to cancel, and that I had to be on hold all that time to be connected, that he couldn\\'t stay on the line with me, to make sure I didn\\'t get disconnected in the interim.  At this point, I had already been on the phone with Expedia for almost 20 minutes, and waiting another 20-30 minutes (the usual 1.5x multiplier when customer service agents tell you anticipated hold times for a supervisor) just to cancel a flight I had paid for was frustrating, and I told him he wasn\\'t managing my expectations well.  He eventually did connect me to Ed, his supervisor in the Philippines, who took another 5-10 minutes trying to explain the inflexibility in the cancellation rules, when I kept interrupting him to stop telling me the rules, to please cancel first, and then he can explain the rules.  Finally, at the 32 minute mark, he agreed to do so, but it took him another 2 minutes to do so.  I\\'m a long time Expedia user, I was one of the early adopters of their platform.  I will NEVER use them again.  They need to empower their customer service agents to solve problems, not delay the conversation hoping the customer will go away (happy or not) so they can keep their money.  They also need to empower their supervisors to do the same, instead of dragging out the conversations to make people hang up in frustration.DON\\'T USE EXPEDIA!!!  They will NOT support you, and even though I purchased travel insurance and was changing my flight because of an impending snow storm in the Northeast US, they wasted half an hour of vacation I will never get back, as well as guaranteeing that I will never use them again.  I would give the 0 stars if I could.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Horrible customer service  ! They are completely rude, & the management team is even worse. I would never recommend Expedia to anyone !!!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                was told to wait 8 weeks for a refund and even after the 8 weeks I am now told I need to file a claim with my bank! Worst company ever! Will never use them again! BEWARE they will take your money and tell you sorry about your bad luck!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                The worst of the worst.Please,don\\'t ever book with this company.......Fraud.....\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Would really recommend staying clear of this company. We booked a flight with them, and through circumstances outside of our control, missed the first leg of the 38 hour multiple-flight-trip. There was plenty of time to rearrange flights and make the rest of the journey, and we were advised by one Expedia staff member that we had only been marked as \\'missing\\' our first leg and that our return journey and the remainder of our departing journey was still active, and able to be modified and kept. We expected to have to pay fees to change things. Instead, we spent the next six hours being redirected to multiple call centers and received conflicting information from multiple Expedia supervisors which resulted in us missing the remainder of the flights, and Expedia advising us to pay an additional $3,800 to re-book. Essentially, we were intentionally misinformed which resulted in financial gain by the company.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Well after my appalling booking episode a few years ago, I thought I would try and book another holiday today.  Just wasted two hours of my time and lost a holiday because of it.  I wanted 10 -11 nights away somewhere hot, last minute.  I stupidly went on chat and the person was very good saying they had seen I had been looking at Cancun (just slightly out of my budget) but they could give me Punta Cana in my budget and could I wait for them to bring it up.  A few minutes later and I was impressed and they offered a hotel I really liked at a reasonable price,and then I realised it was for one night only - the flight arrived after 8pm at night and left at 8am the following day taking another day to get back.  So actually only a few hours in resort at what was supposed to be a 10 night deal at 10 night xmas prices.  This was withdrawn but they didn\\'t admit they had made a mistake.  They then offered me lots of other rubbish so called deals, in 2 star hotels with an 11.5 hour connection, when I had mentioned I wanted a maximum of 4 on numerous occasions.  I even increased my budget by quite a bit and they  offered me Tenerife.  Nothing wrong with Tenerife we have been numerous times but when I declined this I was offered it again saying it was a good deal as just below my now increased budget.  It was like they didn\\'t actually read my messages and because I spent so long potentially waiting for them to help me, like they asked me to, I have actually lost a holiday I was going to go for with a different operator.  My kids are now very very upset as we can\\'t go away boxing day as planned, and I have wasted most of Christmas Eve trying to get a holiday booked with expedia.  Please think twice before using, or at least call and speak to a real person - my mistake and now my family is left without a holiday.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Never rent a car through Expedia. They accepted my reservation and gave me a confirmation number for an office that was closed. I was not able to rent a car and they offer no support. I suggest that you chose another website to reserve a car. Expedia will take reservation without confirming the business hours of the car rental office and will offer no assistance.\\r\\n            ']\n"

And their reason was I didn't add my Nectar number. Which I did on every booking.I will not used Expedia again.J. Darmo\\r\\n            \", 'I’ve used Expedia many times to book travel. They are great as long as you don’t have to make any changes to your booking. However, if you need to make any changes or modifications, they are horrible.  We booked a flight that was cancelled so we had to reschedule. Gave them a call and told them which flight we wanted and they said we should hear back from them in 48-72 hours when the change has been made. Didn’t hear from them. Called again and was told they would confirm in 48-72 hrs. Didn’t hear from them. With the power of social media, and after a bad tweet, they contacted me to help me with the problem. By this time, we couldn’t get on the flight we wanted and was waitlisted. We decided to call the airline directly ourselves and they said that there was still seats on the flight and there was still seats being sold on the Expedia website. They told us that if we were able to get through to the airline ourselves then we should just book with them. I’m almost certain that this is what we pay them to do. However, because we booked through Expedia, the airline couldn’t do anything.  We were told by Expedia that they could only contact the airline through email. In a world where technology has advanced so much, how is it that email is the only way for communication?  Expedia ended up booking us on a flight that we didn’t want and left us no choice but to take it. They will do anything to not issue you a refund. Their customer service is terrible and I will never book through them again\\r\\n            ', \"This is the worst experience I've got ever. I booked this hotel through expedia around 5:30pm, then due to my personal reason I tried to cancel on 7pm. Since I booked it through expedia, obviously I called expedia to help cancel this order. The service guy accepted my request, and said there might be some charges deductible, I said since it's my reason I have no problem to bear some costs. Then he asked me on line to wait for result. After 15-20mintues online waiting, he said the hotel disagreed to refund me, but would continue to charge me full. I said now it's only 7pm, and obviously I would not go to hotel for check in, why should I be charged for full amount? Then he suggested me to contact hotel directly. I said no, because I trust expedia, and I take myself as a customer of expedia, and I paid to expedia directly, why should I contact any other third party. Finally he said he will try tomorrow and give me updates, then there was no udpates until today. And the full amount charged next day from my credit card.I'm ok with this $143, cannot hurt me, but I really feel disappointed about expedia. After this matter, I cannot see any value of expedia. Why should I use expedia to book hotels? Expedia should get close cooperation with all partners including this small hotel. But from this matter, I cannot see the professional services or solutions on how to make its customer satisfied. So farewell expedia, you sucks!\\r\\n            \", 'Booked hotel and rental care together to get best deal.  Chose the only car rental vendor that Expedia said had car and counter IN the airport.  Location drove my decision making as my husband is blind and luggage and shuttles make for difficult travel.  Learned on arrival that San Diego has NO counters or cars in airport. Expedia was sloppy and Economy rental is shady.  I pre-paid for insurance and vehicle.  In addition to my pre pay the vender required a very large hold on a card. In addition to the rental fee.  we had issues with this and after discussion with manager it was decided that Economy would refund our money and we would be free to make other plans.  I then learned that my pre-payment was never in the venders hands but still with Expedia.  Manager said I Do not have your money until rental complete and returned i will cancel and you will have to deal with Expedia to get your $.  His nasty grin should have been my first clue that my trouble had just begun! What a disaster speaking to “customer service” outside the US and spent 3.5 hours and a full week before I could get confirmation that they “plan to submit” request for refund.  It was not until I took to Facebook that I got the promise of a refund over a week after we were to start vacation.  There was no reason to make this process difficult!  I can think nothing but that the difficulty is built into their process. Never Again!\\r\\n            ', 'Where to even begin. I have been a frequent traveller for years, up until the last few months I thought Expedia was a good idea. Here are issues that I believe are scams, terrible customer service, and unacceptable:1. Wait time to receive any assistance. In total I have spent upwards of 9 hours on hold waiting for assistance in the span of two weeks, after the Airline kept changing my flights and I had to call to reselect a better flight. I had to ask to be transferred to a different agent a couple of times when they don\\'t understand what is going on (when the flight is changed you have the option to re-select a better flight due to the change at no charge. Some agents don\\'t even know that and try to charge you).2. Advertise false information. a) I rented a car, and when I got to the airport I found out the location I selected wasn\\'t in the airport (My fault for not paying attention even though when booking I clicked that I wanted airport location). I went on Expedia and it said I could cancel with no cost. So I did. THEN I get home and I still got charged and Expedia says \"well we don\\'t charge you a cancellation, but the car rental company does\". That\\'s unbelievable.

They also need to empower their supervisors to do the same, instead of dragging out the conversations to make people hang up in frustration.DON'T USE EXPEDIA!!!  They will NOT support you, and even though I purchased travel insurance and was changing my flight because of an impending snow storm in the Northeast US, they wasted half an hour of vacation I will never get back, as well as guaranteeing that I will never use them again.  I would give the 0 stars if I could.\\r\\n            \", 'Horrible customer service  ! They are completely rude, & the management team is even worse. I would never recommend Expedia to anyone !!!\\r\\n            ', 'was told to wait 8 weeks for a refund and even after the 8 weeks I am now told I need to file a claim with my bank! Worst company ever! Will never use them again! BEWARE they will take your money and tell you sorry about your bad luck!\\r\\n            ', \"The worst of the worst.Please,don't ever book with this company.......Fraud.....\\r\\n            \", \"Would really recommend staying clear of this company. We booked a flight with them, and through circumstances outside of our control, missed the first leg of the 38 hour multiple-flight-trip. There was plenty of time to rearrange flights and make the rest of the journey, and we were advised by one Expedia staff member that we had only been marked as 'missing' our first leg and that our return journey and the remainder of our departing journey was still active, and able to be modified and kept. We expected to have to pay fees to change things. Instead, we spent the next six hours being redirected to multiple call centers and received conflicting information from multiple Expedia supervisors which resulted in us missing the remainder of the flights, and Expedia advising us to pay an additional $3,800 to re-book. Essentially, we were intentionally misinformed which resulted in financial gain by the company.\\r\\n            \", \"Well after my appalling booking episode a few years ago, I thought I would try and book another holiday today.  Just wasted two hours of my time and lost a holiday because of it.  I wanted 10 -11 nights away somewhere hot, last minute.  I stupidly went on chat and the person was very good saying they had seen I had been looking at Cancun (just slightly out of my budget) but they could give me Punta Cana in my budget and could I wait for them to bring it up.  A few minutes later and I was impressed and they offered a hotel I really liked at a reasonable price,and then I realised it was for one night only - the flight arrived after 8pm at night and left at 8am the following day taking another day to get back.  So actually only a few hours in resort at what was supposed to be a 10 night deal at 10 night xmas prices.  This was withdrawn but they didn't admit they had made a mistake.  They then offered me lots of other rubbish so called deals, in 2 star hotels with an 11.5 hour connection, when I had mentioned I wanted a maximum of 4 on numerous occasions.  I even increased my budget by quite a bit and they  offered me Tenerife.  Nothing wrong with Tenerife we have been numerous times but when I declined this I was offered it again saying it was a good deal as just below my now increased budget.  It was like they didn't actually read my messages and because I spent so long potentially waiting for them to help me, like they asked me to, I have actually lost a holiday I was going to go for with a different operator.  My kids are now very very upset as we can't go away boxing day as planned, and I have wasted most of Christmas Eve trying to get a holiday booked with expedia.  Please think twice before using, or at least call and speak to a real person - my mistake and now my family is left without a holiday.\\r\\n            \", 'Never rent a car through Expedia. They accepted my reservation and gave me a confirmation number for an office that was closed. I was not able to rent a car and they offer no support. I suggest that you chose another website to reserve a car.

      "['\\r\\n                When I signed up my friend and I decided to go with a 6 month subscription. A few days ago I saw a charge on my account for a new subscription. I immediately went and cancelled my membership and expected it to be cancelled immediately. I did not receive any emails or noticfications stating my membership was about to expire either. After I cancelled my membership it showed on my account I would be active until 07/2018. I reached out to customer service and explained my situation. I have been VERY sick the past few months and at this point have to put my dating life on hold to focus on my health. I have been back and forth between doctors, hospitals and specialists while working full time and helping take care of my nephew. I decided it is time to work on my health and put any dating aside. I very nicely requested a refund and was told they could bump me to a one month memebership, however the difference was only $7!!! $7 dollars wasore or a slap in the face than saying no to a refund at all. When I asked to speak to a manger I was disconnect on. I have NEVER in my life been treated so poorly by customer service. The employee was less than helpful, had ZERO empathy AND disconnected my chat when I wanted a manager. I have worked customer service for 10 years now and would never and have never spoken to or treated anyone the way I was treated. Stay away, far, far away from match. My experience has been HORRIBLE and when trying to cancel I was treated so poorly. Match has zero compassion and customer service. I will never commend match.com and have passed along my experience to many others.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Be REALLY careful with match. They work hard to catch you out with auto renewal, and take more from you than you intend, but all LEGAL of course. You will find this a VERY common thread so read between the lines.Got me, don\\'t let them get you. Double check auto renewal before it ends or end up upset!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Can\\'t reach to customer support\\r\\n            \\r\\n                They are scam artists. The site automatically takes money out of your account so beware of their charging policy. They would not give me a refund even when I canceled my service. I just wanted to try it for one month and I ended up paying for two months. I would NOT recommend this site at all.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                theft of fundsEven if you turn off autorenew.  Even if you call two days after your account should have ended, they keep the vast majority of your money.Lots of fake profiles, too, but you can work around them.  Wendy F.: Hi, my name is Wendy F..  Please give me a moment to review your account and I\\'ll be right with you.  Wendy F.: I’m sorry to hear you wish to discontinue your time on our site.  Wendy F.: While I review your account, would you please tell me why you want to cancel?  Me: My personal life is in a twist right now.    Wendy F.: I do understand.  Wendy F.: Per your request, I’ve turned off the automatic renewal. You will still be able to utilize the subscriber-only features until the end date of your current subscription on 03/26/2018.  Me: I wanted it to end 12/24.  Me: That\\'s when my subscription was set to expire.  Wendy F.: I\\'m sorry that you weren\\'t aware of our auto-renewal policy.   Me: I do not want to pay for, or have, an account.  Wendy F.: For convenience and to make sure your subscription benefits are never inadvertently lost, all Match subscriptions automatically renew by default when the subscription period is done. This also protects you from rate increases by locking in your rate for as long as you keep your subscription current.  Wendy F.: Here\\'s what we can do.  Wendy F.: While we are unable to process a full refund, I can provide you with a partial refund. Since you are currently within 30 days of the auto renewal, the system would drop you down to a one month subscription.   Me: I had turned off autorenew a month ago.  Wendy F.: The refund would be in the amount of $29.01, which represents the difference in price after converting your subscription to the one month package.  Wendy F.: Please let us know if you would like to proceed with the partial refund.  Me: What was the full term amount charged?  What would be the amount of the refund?  Wendy F.: It doesn\\'t appear that the automatic renewal was ever turned off, so that’s why your subscription renewed. I apologize for the confusion.  Wendy F.: The refund would be in the amount of $29.01, which represents the difference in price after converting your subscription to the one month package.  Me: How much was charged?  Wendy F.: The amount is $80.97 only.  Me: So, because I got charged two days ago for something I didn\\'t want and thought I\\'d turned off, Match keeps $51.96?  Do I have that correct?  Wendy F.: I understand that the amount after the refund may be different from the price you saw advertised on our site. This is because you initially purchased a package subscription, which includes three of our Premium Services at a discounted price.  Wendy F.: Please let us know if you would like to proceed with the partial refund.  Me: Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this theft of my funds.  Is it worth it?  This is really bad public relations.  Can you refund more than the $29 you stated?  Wendy F.: Unfortunately, the system only allows us to issue a refund for $29.01. I’m sorry that’s out of my control.  Me: Whose control is it in?  May I speak with them?  Wendy F.: I understand you wish to speak to a supervisor. I assure you my supervisor will provide the same information I provided you.    Wendy F.: We can only process a partial refund on your account. Would you like to proceed?  Me: Then refund me.  And be assured I personally will never use your service again.  Also be assured that I will let others single people know about this.  Keeping my $50 will end up costing your company more than that in fewer future subscriptions and bad publicity.  Me: You should reconsider who you work for, Wendy.  Wendy F.: I’m sorry you feel the need to do that.   Wendy F.: At this time, that is all I can do.  Wendy F.: Let me process the partial refund now.  Wendy F.: Per your request, I have issued a refund in the amount of $29.01, and it was processed immediately. It was successfully processed on my end, but may take 3-5 business days for your financial institution to receive.  Wendy F.: You will still be able to utilize the subscriber-only features until the end date of your current subscription on 01/23/2018.  Wendy F.: I\\'m really glad I could assist you today. Is there anything else I can help you with?  Wendy F.: Thank you for choosing Match. If there\\'s nothing I am able to assist you with, I\\'ll sign off now but if you have any other questions, take a look at our FAQ page.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                These people (Match.com administrators) are sickening. I paid for a year and, after 1 month, I get a message saying my account has been terminated. I had no idea why, and asked them. They referred me to their \"Terms of Use\", which is voluminous and complicated. I read it anyway and didn\\'t see anything I did to violate any of their terms. I asked them to clarify and they refused to tell me why they terminated my account. In the meantime, I had spent hundreds of hours cultivating relationships on the site, only to have all of those conversations become inaccessible to me as I can\\'t log on to the site. AND, they have my money and refuse to refund it.I would not recommend anybody using this site, as you could be wasting a LOT of time and money, should they arbitrarily decide to pull the rug out from under you for no reason.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Match.com engages in discriminatory business practices, based on gender. Male (and almost exclusively only male) customers are often reported by other users or my match.com employees for \"verbally harassing\" other members, even when they do not communicate with other members at all. While other members\\' reporting may be simply a trolling or revenge practice (resulting from a lack of interest received from male members), match.com employee reporting is a practice directly supported by the company itself. One of the most active corporate-sponsored scammers works under the name \"Tony E.\".Following the completely fake, unfounded accusation(s), the merchant terminates the unsuspecting users\\' account, without looking into the facts or giving any explanation, falsely citing the male user\\'s supposed behavior, while providing no evidence whatsoever, of it. The merchant hides behind its reference to \"privacy policy\" and typically gets away with wrongfully terminating the account with zero explanation or proof of alleged activity given.The merchant then collects the funds for partial or no service rendered, as the terminated member does not get reimbursed for the remainder of the the original, pre-paid subscription term, often at a value in excess of hundreds of dollars. The customer service center refuses to answer inquiries from the wrongfully terminated member, hangs up on the caller, states that it has no relationship with the corporate office itself, which supposedly decides over investigation or cancellations. The only step it recommends is to email the corporate office - but the corporate office refuses to respond to emails altogether.Curiously, though, this scamming practice includes the invitation of user to open up another, brand new account, effectively paying again for the already-purchased service.(!)  Very well organized scam with a well-established brand to cover it. The above findings have been thoroughly documented, and the documentation is now being used in support of a lawsuit by the legal representation of three members, one of which is the author of the above review.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I signed up for a 3-month membership with match.com this past summer. Three years ago I had signed up for a 3-month membership and I don\\'t recall ever having a problem. However, this time was different. After a couple of months of my subscription, I decided I wasn\\'t interested and stopped using the site and was not planning to renew. At the end of the 3-month period, a new charge for match.com appeared on my credit card statement for a new 3-month subscription. I have had this experience before with other companies and realized, somewhere in the small print, I had evidently agreed to let them automatically charge me for a new subscription on my credit card. Whenever I\\'ve contacted other companies in this situation and explained I did not have a desire to renew, they have always cheerfully refunded my money and cancelled the subscription (Barnes & Noble membership and American Greetings membership are two companies that come to mind). But when I called match.com, the representative refused to issue a full refund to me. (She did offer a partial refund, but I would still be paying a significant part of the whole charge.) She was very adamant about it. I told her I had never had this experience before with other companies. I asked to speak to her supervisor, and she told me i could not because the supervisor would tell me the same thing and so it would do no good. I was absolutely floored. This was some of the poorest customer experience I had ever experienced. During the conversation I mentioned I would be writing a negative review of match.com. This did not seem to phase her. After she told me I could not talk to her supervisor, I said I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau. At this point, she asked if she could put me on hold to review my account. A little while later she came back on and told me sweetly I would be fully refunded (which afterward I was). Obviously, the BBB threat (which I carried out) must have caught her attention. I still cannot believe how rudely I was treated and how difficult it was to get a full refund of a subscription I never intended to obtain.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Poor customer care and responses to any specific queries when you have a technical problem. I purchased my subscription via iTunes and was given conflicting advice within 24hrs as couldn\\'t access messages, initially told I had two profiles and not to buy it again from iTunes. I disputed this and they apologised saying they got it wrong and it was okay to purchase from iTunes. Later when I renewed my subs via iTunes and I couldn\\'t use all functions on my iMac they blamed it again on the iTunes purchase. For a so called premium dating site the functionality of the site is poor, glitchy and inferior to some free sites! I\\'m not convinced all the positive reviews of this site are \\'independent\\'.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Stolen £869 from me...Joined in july 2015 cancelled in August 2015. Never used it since. However match.com have continued to take payments from me without my knowledge for a further 29 months.Absolute thieves. Try to get your money back and guess what? The only contact number they give out is a department that can\\'t do refunds. Their customer care team then send you an email explaining how auto renewal works (thanks for that). Also have not even sent me any invoices or emails during this time so I was completely unaware that this money was being taken from me.  In summary:Steal money from your account Terrible customer service that are unable to resolve any issue and apparently do not have phones Do not give this company your card details as I am reading this is a regular occurrence and you will not get your money back!!Raising to the financial ombudsman is my next step. Appalling behaviour from such a large scale company.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I deactivated my account and didn’t turn off the automatic renewal. I called to close my account never logged in but somehow match.com have taken the renewal from me even though I haven’t used this service! It was the same day as renewal that I contacted them and they refused to reverse it for me. The operator Gregor was so rude and put the phone down on me.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I recently signed up for match.com as user name MYSTAGIC, and got a few people that contacted me, but I couldn\\'t view or click on any of this stuff or even know who was viewing me, until I pay for service, so I paid for service to see who was messaging me, so I wrote some responses to a few people and started talking to someone and we were really hitting it off, but I had to sleep it was 3 am, so I logged out and the next day my account was terminated and no indication to why, and I know I didn\\'t write anything offensive or bad, I uploaded a single photo, and barely used the site, I didn\\'t even have service for more then 12 hours so I wasn\\'t even able to setup anything or proceed with talking to the person I was talking with and now that I am no longer on the site I have no way to contact them. Using match.com was one of the most awful experiences I have ever had with any online site. They give no warning or even explain why your service was terminated, when you try to talk to them they simply refuse to give any real information, and after doing so research into this company they have had serious issues dating as far back as 2011. I paid for service on: 10 December 2017 at 00:11 amaccount was terminated at : 10 December 2017 at 06:14 amI only used the site for roughly 3 hours and got permanently terminated, for some unknown reason that they won\\'t even tell me. The only response I got was some automated message of:------------------------------------------------------------Dear MYSTAGIC,We received your inquiry regarding the status of your Match membership. Please know that due to our Terms of Use, your Match account has been terminated. We believe this action to be in the best interests of our member community.We can also confirm that a full refund has been issued. Your bank can provide you more details about when it will appear on your statement, when the funds will be available to you, etc.If you paid to attend an upcoming Match Event, please know your name has been removed from the RSVP list and any charges associated with the event have been refunded.For reference, our Terms of Use can be accessed at the following link:  Regards,Match Corporate Care------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I do not recommend this site for any reason whatsoever. They robbed my chance of talking to someone that I found very interesting, though it\\'s very possible that the activity sent to my account was entirely fake and generated by match.com to be fooled into buying service. Seeing how, not even moments after signing up I receive allegedly all this winks, profile likes, and private messages, from real users, which I find it hard to believe I got all that activity within my first 10 minutes of using the site with a incomplete profile. Then after buying services I could respond to these items. But then suddenly without warning my account is terminated, and I have to get a refund, thankfully, I paid through paypal and have buyer protection. If your looking for dating sites, I wouldn\\'t put match.com any where near my choices, and I will never recommend this site to anyone, and anyone asking about this site, I will tell them the very short experience I had with it.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Match.com is a total scam .. you pay for one month and they take the second month regardless if you want it or not .. I see there are a lot of people who have been conned by them .. there should be something that stops this happening .. I am going to take it to the ombudsman as they shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it!!!!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I was completely  new to this at 57 , never once did i ever imagine dating again in my life  3rd date is now soon to be my wife in 21 days amazing\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Not sure why everyone\\'s complaining?! IMO one of the the top three sites (Mingle2day and Cupid are also worth checking out, btw) Before you start hating realize that 99% of all other dating sites are worse.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                No. Beware the automatic renewal.  Admittedly in this time of sneaky default privacy and pages of money-grabbing T&C\\'s, we should have learned by now that any subscription site is going to default to an auto-renewal. So, i\\'ve just paid £120 for something I never use, and hours after it was auto-taken from my account (now in overdraught), and a little begging from me, did receive a polite email saying there are no exceptions to the T&C\\'s.  Match itself is fine, but after being with match for 6 months, traditional societal patterns do emerge (i\\'ll leave you to think about that) making online just as effective as approaching someone on the street (only, with arguably another layer of safety).  In 2017, even for the most positive optimist, it\\'s an exhausting process writing and writing and trying to be clever and verbose without being overwhelming!  It\\'s a shortcut to fakery.  The online peak is gone… around 2014-2015 a bunch of friends had met long term partners: a phase of tinder-babies and marriages are happening now.Nowadays and after asking a few girl-friends who are online, it seems that online dating is no longer about making new friendships but a simple swiping game for people with a toilet-moment to spare.  :)\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I stopped using the website but then I found a $71 USD charge on my credit card. match.com automatically charged me a 3 month renewal fee of $71 USD two days earlier. I received no email notice from them leading up to the automatic payment. I called their number and the operator said the best he can do is refund me $20.01 and he refused to transfer me to his supervisor. In summary they charged me $51 for a service I did not use.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Awful service, just use a free dating app like tinder or bumble,  they are much easier to use and free! You can tell why they are losing business to the likes of tinder and bumble, because their service is so poor on so many levels.- Customer service is virtually non-existent- Their technology (app) doesnt work properly, often crashes, is slow and clunky and notifications dont work properly- Website is dated and slow, it looks like something out of the dotcom era.- Expensive and con customers out of money: they will automatically renew your subscription unless you go through a convoluted and complicated process to cancel it. I recently had my account terminated and deleted without explanation or prior warning by accident. Eventually, after waiting 2 days for a response, they said my account has been deleted permanently and is not recoverable due to it accidentally tripping some spam filter. Now i\\'ve lost all my match history and people i was chatting to. Their sum response was telling me to set up a new account. Why would i go to the trouble of setting up a new account if there is a risk of them just deleting my account? Hmm, no thanks,\\r\\n            \\r\\n                DANGER! Avoid this dreadful company!Woeful service and experience from the most expensive dating site around.I will never use them again, after my account was terminated and permanently deleted for \"unusual behaviour\" which they then admitted was a result of their moderation system failing. As a result i lost all my history and messages.They just told me to set up a new account, and that was it. I paid up front for a subscription and as of today, they still hold my money even though i dont even have an account with them.Their customer service standards are appalling, i rang several times for various reasons and after eventually getting through after ages of waiting on hold i always spoke to someone called Brad, which meant they had barely anyone in their customer service team. I received stock replies from their robotic staff.WARNING: Match will automatically renew your subscription when its due to expire, which means they will take money from your credit card without you knowing. They clearly do this to make an extra buck and rely on people not checking their bank accounts. Theoretically you can call to cancel, but every time i did this it took me ages to get through, costing me phone charges.The phone app for match is absolutely dreadful too! It often crashes, notifications never get delivered and it just stops functioning inexplicably.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                My account got hacked!  Some lady put two photos on my profile, messaged a whole lot of people, \\'liked\\' people I wouldn\\'t of \\'liked\\', and then blocked a whole bunch. Not a very secure site apparently. I called Match to try to get a refund and they flat refused.   Be very cautious, possibility of LOVE, may not be worth it.\\r\\n            ']\n"

I have been back and forth between doctors, hospitals and specialists while working full time and helping take care of my nephew. I decided it is time to work on my health and put any dating aside. I very nicely requested a refund and was told they could bump me to a one month memebership, however the difference was only $7!!! $7 dollars wasore or a slap in the face than saying no to a refund at all. When I asked to speak to a manger I was disconnect on. I have NEVER in my life been treated so poorly by customer service. The employee was less than helpful, had ZERO empathy AND disconnected my chat when I wanted a manager. I have worked customer service for 10 years now and would never and have never spoken to or treated anyone the way I was treated. Stay away, far, far away from match. My experience has been HORRIBLE and when trying to cancel I was treated so poorly. Match has zero compassion and customer service. I will never commend match.com and have passed along my experience to many others.\\r\\n            ', \"Be REALLY careful with match.

Even if you call two days after your account should have ended, they keep the vast majority of your money.Lots of fake profiles, too, but you can work around them.  Wendy F.: Hi, my name is Wendy F..  Please give me a moment to review your account and I'll be right with you.  Wendy F.: I’m sorry to hear you wish to discontinue your time on our site.  Wendy F.: While I review your account, would you please tell me why you want to cancel?  Me: My personal life is in a twist right now.    Wendy F.: I do understand.  Wendy F.: Per your request, I’ve turned off the automatic renewal. You will still be able to utilize the subscriber-only features until the end date of your current subscription on 03/26/2018.  Me: I wanted it to end 12/24.  Me: That's when my subscription was set to expire.  Wendy F.: I'm sorry that you weren't aware of our auto-renewal policy.   Me: I do not want to pay for, or have, an account.  Wendy F.: For convenience and to make sure your subscription benefits are never inadvertently lost, all Match subscriptions automatically renew by default when the subscription period is done. This also protects you from rate increases by locking in your rate for as long as you keep your subscription current.  Wendy F.: Here's what we can do.  Wendy F.: While we are unable to process a full refund, I can provide you with a partial refund. Since you are currently within 30 days of the auto renewal, the system would drop you down to a one month subscription.   Me: I had turned off autorenew a month ago.  Wendy F.: The refund would be in the amount of $29.01, which represents the difference in price after converting your subscription to the one month package.  Wendy F.: Please let us know if you would like to proceed with the partial refund.  Me: What was the full term amount charged?  What would be the amount of the refund?  Wendy F.: It doesn't appear that the automatic renewal was ever turned off, so that’s why your subscription renewed. I apologize for the confusion.  Wendy F.: The refund would be in the amount of $29.01, which represents the difference in price after converting your subscription to the one month package.  Me: How much was charged?  Wendy F.: The amount is $80.97 only.  Me: So, because I got charged two days ago for something I didn't want and thought I'd turned off, Match keeps $51.96?  Do I have that correct?  Wendy F.: I understand that the amount after the refund may be different from the price you saw advertised on our site. This is because you initially purchased a package subscription, which includes three of our Premium Services at a discounted price.  Wendy F.: Please let us know if you would like to proceed with the partial refund.  Me: Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this theft of my funds.  Is it worth it?  This is really bad public relations.  Can you refund more than the $29 you stated?  Wendy F.: Unfortunately, the system only allows us to issue a refund for $29.01. I’m sorry that’s out of my control.  Me: Whose control is it in?  May I speak with them?  Wendy F.: I understand you wish to speak to a supervisor. I assure you my supervisor will provide the same information I provided you.    Wendy F.: We can only process a partial refund on your account. Would you like to proceed?  Me: Then refund me.  And be assured I personally will never use your service again.  Also be assured that I will let others single people know about this.  Keeping my $50 will end up costing your company more than that in fewer future subscriptions and bad publicity.  Me: You should reconsider who you work for, Wendy.  Wendy F.: I’m sorry you feel the need to do that.   Wendy F.: At this time, that is all I can do.  Wendy F.: Let me process the partial refund now.  Wendy F.: Per your request, I have issued a refund in the amount of $29.01, and it was processed immediately. It was successfully processed on my end, but may take 3-5 business days for your financial institution to receive.  Wendy F.: You will still be able to utilize the subscriber-only features until the end date of your current subscription on 01/23/2018.  Wendy F.: I'm really glad I could assist you today. Is there anything else I can help you with?  Wendy F.: Thank you for choosing Match. If there's nothing I am able to assist you with, I'll sign off now but if you have any other questions, take a look at our FAQ page.\\r\\n            \", 'These people (Match.com administrators) are sickening.

I asked them to clarify and they refused to tell me why they terminated my account. In the meantime, I had spent hundreds of hours cultivating relationships on the site, only to have all of those conversations become inaccessible to me as I can\\'t log on to the site. AND, they have my money and refuse to refund it.I would not recommend anybody using this site, as you could be wasting a LOT of time and money, should they arbitrarily decide to pull the rug out from under you for no reason.\\r\\n            ', 'Match.com engages in discriminatory business practices, based on gender. Male (and almost exclusively only male) customers are often reported by other users or my match.com employees for \"verbally harassing\" other members, even when they do not communicate with other members at all. While other members\\' reporting may be simply a trolling or revenge practice (resulting from a lack of interest received from male members), match.com employee reporting is a practice directly supported by the company itself. One of the most active corporate-sponsored scammers works under the name \"Tony E.\".Following the completely fake, unfounded accusation(s), the merchant terminates the unsuspecting users\\' account, without looking into the facts or giving any explanation, falsely citing the male user\\'s supposed behavior, while providing no evidence whatsoever, of it. The merchant hides behind its reference to \"privacy policy\" and typically gets away with wrongfully terminating the account with zero explanation or proof of alleged activity given.The merchant then collects the funds for partial or no service rendered, as the terminated member does not get reimbursed for the remainder of the the original, pre-paid subscription term, often at a value in excess of hundreds of dollars. The customer service center refuses to answer inquiries from the wrongfully terminated member, hangs up on the caller, states that it has no relationship with the corporate office itself, which supposedly decides over investigation or cancellations. The only step it recommends is to email the corporate office - but the corporate office refuses to respond to emails altogether.Curiously, though, this scamming practice includes the invitation of user to open up another, brand new account, effectively paying again for the already-purchased service.(!)  Very well organized scam with a well-established brand to cover it. The above findings have been thoroughly documented, and the documentation is now being used in support of a lawsuit by the legal representation of three members, one of which is the author of the above review.\\r\\n            ', \"I signed up for a 3-month membership with match.com this past summer. Three years ago I had signed up for a 3-month membership and I don't recall ever having a problem. However, this time was different. After a couple of months of my subscription, I decided I wasn't interested and stopped using the site and was not planning to renew. At the end of the 3-month period, a new charge for match.com appeared on my credit card statement for a new 3-month subscription. I have had this experience before with other companies and realized, somewhere in the small print, I had evidently agreed to let them automatically charge me for a new subscription on my credit card. Whenever I've contacted other companies in this situation and explained I did not have a desire to renew, they have always cheerfully refunded my money and cancelled the subscription (Barnes & Noble membership and American Greetings membership are two companies that come to mind). But when I called match.com, the representative refused to issue a full refund to me. (She did offer a partial refund, but I would still be paying a significant part of the whole charge.) She was very adamant about it. I told her I had never had this experience before with other companies. I asked to speak to her supervisor, and she told me i could not because the supervisor would tell me the same thing and so it would do no good. I was absolutely floored. This was some of the poorest customer experience I had ever experienced. During the conversation I mentioned I would be writing a negative review of match.com. This did not seem to phase her. After she told me I could not talk to her supervisor, I said I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau. At this point, she asked if she could put me on hold to review my account. A little while later she came back on and told me sweetly I would be fully refunded (which afterward I was). Obviously, the BBB threat (which I carried out) must have caught her attention. I still cannot believe how rudely I was treated and how difficult it was to get a full refund of a subscription I never intended to obtain.\\r\\n            \", \"Poor customer care and responses to any specific queries when you have a technical problem. I purchased my subscription via iTunes and was given conflicting advice within 24hrs as couldn't access messages, initially told I had two profiles and not to buy it again from iTunes. I disputed this and they apologised saying they got it wrong and it was okay to purchase from iTunes. Later when I renewed my subs via iTunes and I couldn't use all functions on my iMac they blamed it again on the iTunes purchase. For a so called premium dating site the functionality of the site is poor, glitchy and inferior to some free sites!

Using match.com was one of the most awful experiences I have ever had with any online site.

Please know that due to our Terms of Use, your Match account has been terminated. We believe this action to be in the best interests of our member community.We can also confirm that a full refund has been issued.

They robbed my chance of talking to someone that I found very interesting, though it's very possible that the activity sent to my account was entirely fake and generated by match.com to be fooled into buying service. Seeing how, not even moments after signing up I receive allegedly all this winks, profile likes, and private messages, from real users, which I find it hard to believe I got all that activity within my first 10 minutes of using the site with a incomplete profile. Then after buying services I could respond to these items. But then suddenly without warning my account is terminated, and I have to get a refund, thankfully, I paid through paypal and have buyer protection. If your looking for dating sites, I wouldn't put match.com any where near my choices, and I will never recommend this site to anyone, and anyone asking about this site, I will tell them the very short experience I had with it.\\r\\n            \", 'Match.com is a total scam .. you pay for one month and they take the second month regardless if you want it or not ..

The online peak is gone… around 2014-2015 a bunch of friends had met long term partners: a phase of tinder-babies and marriages are happening now.Nowadays and after asking a few girl-friends who are online, it seems that online dating is no longer about making new friendships but a simple swiping game for people with a toilet-moment to spare.  :)\\r\\n            \", 'I stopped using the website but then I found a $71 USD charge on my credit card. match.com automatically charged me a 3 month renewal fee of $71 USD two days earlier.

They clearly do this to make an extra buck and rely on people not checking their bank accounts.

The reason given to me is that the Walmart site had incorrect information and they apologized for the error. The new estimated ship date was Dec 28. I canceled my contractor and re-scheduled. On Dec 22, I received an email from both Walmart and Wayfair that due to being unable to make the shipment date, they are refunding my purchase price. I went on the Walmart and Wayfair sites and the new price is $504. 2 are in stock at Wayfair. They just didn\\'t want to honor my price that I thought was a binding contract and used some excuse that that couldn\\'t deliver to get out of the obligation of selling it to me at that price. Not my problem. Internet shopping is supposed to offer some sort of confidence. If I am in a real store. If the price tag on the item comes up different on the register, they have to honor what it was tagged with. I have now found the $504 price also on Amazon.

Once we arrived and spoke to the woman at the customer service desk, she informed us that the purchase was a \"third party\" purchase, that Walmart does not honor those returns and we would have to try to return it directly to the manufacturer. Long story short, the manufacturer would not refund our money to us for the reasons that can best be summed up as .. whatever they can make up in order to keep it. We then went through Visa to cancel the purchase however after the 30 day period Visa notified us that they would not allow for the cancellation because Walmart told them we did not follow their return procedures.... which was a lie!

When I go on the Walmart site to check tracking, FEDEX advises (on Walmarts site) that the package was undeliverable and damaged , and to contact the shipper (Walmart). You would think that Walmart would automatically fix this but NO....It\\'s Walmart and I  have to waste my time   I\\'ve looked all over their site and spent an hr trying to find a way to notify them it was never received  and cannot find any way to let them known and get a credit issued  or replaced.Seeing  as there prices are higher on line and they make it so difficult to deal with, there is simply no advantage to ordering on line that I can see. It\\'s way to difficult, takes so much time and tough to determine if you are saving any money . IT HAS TO BE THEIR ON LINE MARKETING  BUSINESS PLANI not here to promote another online ordering  service, but if this is their  attempt  to compete with Amazon they failed miserably.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Great store and people\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Ordered video game on sale to pick-up in store.

Looked online they did have video game in stock but no longer on sale and $20 more expensive.  Spoke with \"Ken\" in Texas at corporate office who stated \"There is nothing he can do\" .   So I will be shopping at Amazon from now on and get my item in two days at the price listed!!!!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Great Service.

Ordered on Dec 9, 2017, Promised ship date was Dec 19. The sink did not arrive. I inquired to Walmart who contacted Wayfair on my behalf. The reason given to me is that the Walmart site had incorrect information and they apologized for the error. The new estimated ship date was Dec 28. I canceled my contractor and re-scheduled. On Dec 22, I received an email from both Walmart and Wayfair that due to being unable to make the shipment date, they are refunding my purchase price. I went on the Walmart and Wayfair sites and the new price is $504. 2 are in stock at Wayfair. They just didn't want to honor my price that I thought was a binding contract and used some excuse that that couldn't deliver to get out of the obligation of selling it to me at that price. Not my problem. Internet shopping is supposed to offer some sort of confidence. If I am in a real store. If the price tag on the item comes up different on the register, they have to honor what it was tagged with. I have now found the $504 price also on Amazon.

Once we arrived and spoke to the woman at the customer service desk, she informed us that the purchase was a \"third party\" purchase, that Walmart does not honor those returns and we would have to try to return it directly to the manufacturer. Long story short, the manufacturer would not refund our money to us for the reasons that can best be summed up as .. whatever they can make up in order to keep it. We then went through Visa to cancel the purchase however after the 30 day period Visa notified us that they would not allow for the cancellation because Walmart told them we did not follow their return procedures.... which was a lie!

For some reason Realtor.com has more search result than other property search\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Awesome! Outstanding service. I am amazed at the qui5, professional response.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I am not getting calls back from Realetors because the homes I am looking for are in the 20,000.00 dollar range.. Very petty..\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Just looking for now, have emailed a few homes for sale.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I dont like the app. low quality compared to other sites.Doesn't show price on map.Needs a better map with lot lines.Very basic low quailty.It a waste of my time and others.Sorry but it's just my honest opinion...I should add, I also go back to Zillow!!!! Which should make some improvements.Like Lot lines should be viewable when zooming in on maps.Better usage of the bedroom numbers.For example: it you highlight 3 and 4 bedrooms. Some house's with either numbers wont show up... So you really have to do separate searches. To view all the homes.With that said! I always come back to Zillow, because its better..\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I like the pages,it has the info that I need.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I ask about a house and nobody answered me.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Simply a good program to help you find a home of your dreams\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Tyler Carr and his staff at Realtor.com are simply rude, dishonest and unprofessional: they first get you on the phone to sell you leads and don't tell you, that you will be in a contract with them until its too late. They do not have you sign anything and when you ask for a copy of the contract they straight up say...you don't have a contract, then turn around and say it was a verbal contract. Then when you call them because there leads are not any good and you would like to cancel, they become aggressive with you and lie to you and start accusing you of being unprofessional. They tell you they will not cancel your account no matter what. They promise you leads, yet do not provide leads, you call and ask them to cancel then they tell you that one: The leads are probably in your spam box and two: you had a verbal contract with them and you are now in a contract for a year. They continue to bill your account no matter what, we even canceled the card on file and they still billed our account telling us, that they have a way to bill through your bank account as a merchant account, even after you change the card.  This is a total scam and the most unprofessional form of business we have seen in the Real Estate profession.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Hello, love the sites and information gathered ... We plan to retire within 2 years and move.   We may be starting a little early, but want to know what the market is now.  We know it may change.   Our goal is to downsize, sell our existing home and go to a warmer climate.\\r\\n            \\r\\n                Thus far in seeking to 'view' homes for sale in the 150 to 300K Burlington, VT area realtor.com has done their very best to post current homes for our review almost daily (And it's appreciated). We currently live out of state, in an area that folks from all over the world visit on a regular basis where we make our living as art gallery owners and artists ourselves. We are looking to be in the 'down-town' area of Burlington in a home with one, or two apartments (Smaller in-law apt. attached for our youngest child), a garage (Or, 'out building' to be used as a woodworking and glass blowing shop), on a large enough property to be free of the 'over-the-fence' peering eyes of nosey neighbors. As it is a 6 to 8 hour drive from where we live to actually view a potential home in VT I/we especially appreciate the effort this company brings to make life that much easier. Thank-you! Rick Meehan\\r\\n            \\r\\n                You did not really help me in any way shape or form. I had to look for my own home and then contact you to see it.

We, our realtor and ourselves, have tried everything, and I mean everything, to get Realtor to correct the amount of taxes they've listed on our home.  The amount they list is over $225 a month more and drives up what someone thinks they would pay monthly.

When I was sold my area I was told I would be the only person with the unshared plan. That's a LIE! I have called and spoke to them and they discounted my plan by $ 10 but I still have not received any leads that are not under contract  since the discount. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE  after you purchase!! Relator's BEWARE!\\r\\n            \\r\\n                I was looking at a manufactured home in the Monterey Bay Area and contacted the realtor in charge of the property.

      "['|This hits primarily TV series and it gets painfully obvious after a while. You get Short wait, long wait or very long wait for disc #1 of a DVD season. What their system wants to say is that customers always want to watch the first disc of a TV season before getting the second disc. So let\\'s say that you have a 5 disc TV season in your queue. That\\'s 5 individual discs. Netflix tags disc #1 as long wait and none of the discs for the season are shipped. But if you change the sequence in your queue from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 you will get 2 - 5 pretty much immediately and disc #1 is left hanging as \"long wait\". If you want to give Netflix the benefit of a great doubt, you will have to believe that Netflix carries 1 copy of disc 1 and 50 copies of disc 2.|In my case I have disc #1\\'s of TV seasons for 2 months or more in my queue: Humans Season 2, Death in Paradise Season 6, Game of Thrones Season 7, American Gods Season 1. All of these are sitting with short wait or long wait for disc 1 for up to 2 months. So long that I can get TV series through my local library system (with a check-out time of 3 weeks) before Netflix has them available. Unless I am willing to grant Netflix that great benefit of a doubt I have to conclude that Netflix is deliberately degrading their service. Of course, they closed their service on Saturdays and they will probably soon reduce operations from 8 hours to 6. Once they drive off a few more customers they will be able to shut down entirely with a clear conscience.|When trying to redeem a Netflix gift card I was unable to redeem it because I pay my bill through iTunes. I was told I would have to cancel my account, open another one up and pay more each month because the monthly rate is different now.

I have never been hacked but I was charged twice in 1 month long ago when it was like 7.99 month with 1 DVD rental. As in 2011 I think. They issued refund and 3 months free.

Today I realized that since the first month I signed up (June 2012) I have been getting charged twice a month by Netflix - every month until now!!! I called and was very polite and calm but was told, \"We are only allowed to offer a few months free and a three-month refund.\" They could PHYSICALLY see where I was charged every month twice for 4 years!!!

They never add new movies and had the audacity to raise the price and not a little. It is ridiculous. I think I will cancel my Netflix. It\\'s not worth $1.|I\\'ve been a customer with Netflix for a few years and like them, but in my second year I started seeing other names in my account that had been viewing movies. So I called Netflix and told them about it and all they told me was to log out and log back in and that should delete that person out. So it worked for a while and then it happen again so I did the step again. Since then I haven\\'t had that problem again. Meanwhile I haven\\'t been watching Netflix for awhile so I decided to go watch a movies to find out they close out my account because I haven\\'t watched movies in a while. They told me that\\'s why they close my account so they told me if I reopen it I have to change my password and my email so I did. |So later on down the road I did the same thing. Didn\\'t watch Netflix for awhile. They closed my account out again and told me to reopen it using another password and email after they told me to change my password and email three times for security purpose and because I don\\'t watch enough movies to keep my account open. So that\\'s why they keep asking me to change my password, they went behind my back and charge me for the other two account that was close by them plus the new account so I called them. The first time it happen they refunded me back all my money. Now it happen again. The same old accounts they closed out, they keep reopen them and keep charging me for them and this time I spoke to one of the representative.

Why I can\\'t get that back?\" She said because that was suppose to be taken out anyhow. I said, \"No it don\\'t because y\\'all told me to close that account out. Why are you still charging me.\" They owe me 7.99 dollars. I want feedback to see if I can get my money back.|Netflix just sent notification for another price increase. I have already been dissatisfied with selection and the high volume of subtitle movies I have no interest in watching. It takes too long for new things to be added and way too many low budget movies. It takes at least a year and usually longer for popular shows to be added. Sorry Netflix, but I\\'m going with Hulu which is far better. You want to keep making price increases when I\\'m sure I was locked in but have had price increase a few times. What you offer is not worth it.|Anyone who knows me knows I used to be a huge advocate of Netflix and that is for one reason... How I Met Your Mother! Netflix took it off and I have lost my bedtime show. So goodbye Netflix. Hello Hulu. I have used Netflix for years but I will suffer through Hulu’s commercials if I have to until Netflix gets their ** together... That is all! Bring back HIMYM!!|When I started with Netflix years ago we loved it!! Over the years it has gone down. We have watched everything and it was something the whole family enjoyed doing. They have taken so many of our favorite shows off and added all the bs... I cancelled my subscription after 4 years and just decided last night to activate it again (it\\'s been about 3 months wanted to see if they had anything new). After subscribing I get an e-mail saying the price is going up in December. Now here\\'s my real question!!?? I understand Netflix is in debt but is it really fair to say you\\'re bumping the price up so you can add more movies?? Why can\\'t you say \"we messed up by adding all these high rated movies and can\\'t afford to pay out therefore we need you (the customers) to pull us out of debt\"?? Be honest with your customers!!! So once again I\\'m cancelling my subscription and going somewhere else!! Thanks Netflix!!!|Netflix customer service has been amazing every time I\\'ve called. I\\'ve never been on hold for longer than 1 minute, never been given wrong info. Comcast and DIRECTV have some major learning to do. Thank you Netflix for never having done me wrong like the other companies have. You have never overcharged me like the other companies have either.|My account was hacked. Us being forced to close our account because we did not have our credit card at the moment to confirm our identity. When we called back within 1 hour to confirm they would not grant us our seniority since before 2012 at the price we had. They wanted to charge us more. Asked to speak with supervisor and no one came on. They either hide or the employees refused to put them on. We spoke to 4 representatives.|I love Netflix, don’t get me wrong, but hearing about all of the fantastic and entertaining content they are removing from the website makes me VERY upset. For example, some classics like The Break-Up and Sky High are just a small amount that I LOVE to watch whenever I feel like it. Netflix also took off The Titanic, which made me consider deleting my account altogether. So ATTENTION NETFLIX, you will be losing an extreme amount of publicity and popularity if you keep up with all of these removals. I might just end up having to switch to another company like Hulu or Vudu.|It is quite annoying realizing that I can\\'t select shows by fast scanning the stars ranking. Though I don\\'t know whether the star system is deleted for good or only a short-term problem, hope they will get fixed soon.|Used to be a great service. They took away the rating system - which was a great system that let customers actually review the content - and replaced it with a system that does not work, doesn\\'t allow feedback, and doesn\\'t actually help you find anything. (Pretty sure this was all because they were getting such horrible reviews on their failed Amy Schumer bit). They\\'ve now taken down a SEVERE number of series that they used to have available and replaced them with much more mediocre series that are produced by them. I only keep my subscription for a few movies and shows - they get rid of those too, and I\\'m gone.|What chaps my cheeks about Netflix the most... is how when I click on a movie or show to add to my list, it automatically starts playing... and adds an additional 20 seconds to add the feature to my playlist... or to remove it... or to select an episode... or to just read about the feature... What doesn\\'t chap my cheeks, but does hinder my heart, is how there are only 8 episodes of The Defenders... I work out at home, and only watch superhero stories when I want to workout, to get me motivated... I\\'ve stretched out the defenders as long as I could, but it\\'s about to be completed. On a related matter... Sense8! Roar!|I have had the DVD service and the streaming both. The service has been great, if my bank acct is dry, they wait patiently, and then continue on as usual once payment goes thru. I have no complaints so far.|Netflix is having technical difficulties which are interfering with my ability to use my account. I have spent hours on the phone with Netflix customer service agents & floor supervisors & everyone is telling me something different. One supervisor admitted there is a \"known issue affecting many customers\" but the agents and some other supervisors don\\'t seem to know anything about it... or just won\\'t admit it. I\\'m frustrated with all the hours on the phone trying to get this straightened out. Some calls are routed overseas. Some agents are rude & incompetent. They finally said only way to fix is cancel service and open new account. And now ANOTHER PRICE INCREASE! When I first signed up for Netflix years ago there weren\\'t a lot of other options... now there are. Shopping around for better service!!! I see HULU is about the same price & has Seinfeld & tons of other good stuff!|I wish there were more current releases of movies and easier way to find these movies. I like to see more classic tv shows such as Donna Reed and Father Knows Best.|I love Netflix due to the fact that when I\\'m stressing and need a movie to help me relax there\\'s my Netflix.

KEEP UP THE GOOD JOB.|Netflix is an excellent choice to streaming and it has a wide variety of choices. No matter what you\\'re into, you\\'ll find something to watch.

She told me that, \"We can refund you only one account back,\" which they did but I said, \"Y\\'all suppose to refund me back two account not one.\" She said I watch movies in October so she will charge partial for that month so when December come they won\\'t charge full but I said, \"What about the other for 7.99 dollars that you didn\\'t refund back. Why I can\\'t get that back?\" She said because that was suppose to be taken out anyhow. I said, \"No it don\\'t because y\\'all told me to close that account out. Why are you still charging me.\" They owe me 7.99 dollars. I want feedback to see if I can get my money back.', \"Netflix just sent notification for another price increase. I have already been dissatisfied with selection and the high volume of subtitle movies I have no interest in watching. It takes too long for new things to be added and way too many low budget movies. It takes at least a year and usually longer for popular shows to be added. Sorry Netflix, but I'm going with Hulu which is far better. You want to keep making price increases when I'm sure I was locked in but have had price increase a few times. What you offer is not worth it.\", 'Anyone who knows me knows I used to be a huge advocate of Netflix and that is for one reason... How I Met Your Mother! Netflix took it off and I have lost my bedtime show. So goodbye Netflix. Hello Hulu. I have used Netflix for years but I will suffer through Hulu’s commercials if I have to until Netflix gets their ** together... That is all! Bring back HIMYM!!', 'When I started with Netflix years ago we loved it!! Over the years it has gone down. We have watched everything and it was something the whole family enjoyed doing. They have taken so many of our favorite shows off and added all the bs... I cancelled my subscription after 4 years and just decided last night to activate it again (it\\'s been about 3 months wanted to see if they had anything new). After subscribing I get an e-mail saying the price is going up in December. Now here\\'s my real question!!?? I understand Netflix is in debt but is it really fair to say you\\'re bumping the price up so you can add more movies?? Why can\\'t you say \"we messed up by adding all these high rated movies and can\\'t afford to pay out therefore we need you (the customers) to pull us out of debt\"?? Be honest with your customers!!! So once again I\\'m cancelling my subscription and going somewhere else!! Thanks Netflix!!!', \"Netflix customer service has been amazing every time I've called. I've never been on hold for longer than 1 minute, never been given wrong info. Comcast and DIRECTV have some major learning to do. Thank you Netflix for never having done me wrong like the other companies have. You have never overcharged me like the other companies have either.\", 'My account was hacked. Us being forced to close our account because we did not have our credit card at the moment to confirm our identity. When we called back within 1 hour to confirm they would not grant us our seniority since before 2012 at the price we had. They wanted to charge us more. Asked to speak with supervisor and no one came on. They either hide or the employees refused to put them on. We spoke to 4 representatives.', 'I love Netflix, don’t get me wrong, but hearing about all of the fantastic and entertaining content they are removing from the website makes me VERY upset. For example, some classics like The Break-Up and Sky High are just a small amount that I LOVE to watch whenever I feel like it. Netflix also took off The Titanic, which made me consider deleting my account altogether. So ATTENTION NETFLIX, you will be losing an extreme amount of publicity and popularity if you keep up with all of these removals. I might just end up having to switch to another company like Hulu or Vudu.', \"It is quite annoying realizing that I can't select shows by fast scanning the stars ranking. Though I don't know whether the star system is deleted for good or only a short-term problem, hope they will get fixed soon.\", \"Used to be a great service. They took away the rating system - which was a great system that let customers actually review the content - and replaced it with a system that does not work, doesn't allow feedback, and doesn't actually help you find anything. (Pretty sure this was all because they were getting such horrible reviews on their failed Amy Schumer bit). They've now taken down a SEVERE number of series that they used to have available and replaced them with much more mediocre series that are produced by them. I only keep my subscription for a few movies and shows - they get rid of those too, and I'm gone.\", \"What chaps my cheeks about Netflix the most... is how when I click on a movie or show to add to my list, it automatically starts playing... and adds an additional 20 seconds to add the feature to my playlist... or to remove it... or to select an episode... or to just read about the feature... What doesn't chap my cheeks, but does hinder my heart, is how there are only 8 episodes of The Defenders... I work out at home, and only watch superhero stories when I want to workout, to get me motivated... I've stretched out the defenders as long as I could, but it's about to be completed. On a related matter... Sense8! Roar!\", 'I have had the DVD service and the streaming both. The service has been great, if my bank acct is dry, they wait patiently, and then continue on as usual once payment goes thru. I have no complaints so far.', 'Netflix is having technical difficulties which are interfering with my ability to use my account. I have spent hours on the phone with Netflix customer service agents & floor supervisors & everyone is telling me something different. One supervisor admitted there is a \"known issue affecting many customers\" but the agents and some other supervisors don\\'t seem to know anything about it... or just won\\'t admit it. I\\'m frustrated with all the hours on the phone trying to get this straightened out. Some calls are routed overseas. Some agents are rude & incompetent. They finally said only way to fix is cancel service and open new account. And now ANOTHER PRICE INCREASE! When I first signed up for Netflix years ago there weren\\'t a lot of other options... now there are. Shopping around for better service!!! I see HULU is about the same price & has Seinfeld & tons of other good stuff!', 'I wish there were more current releases of movies and easier way to find these movies. I like to see more classic tv shows such as Donna Reed and Father Knows Best.', \"I love Netflix due to the fact that when I'm stressing and need a movie to help me relax there's my Netflix. It helped a lot especially through my knee surgery.\", 'I enjoy Netflix, they have a great variety of movies for all ages which is great. They are doing a great job. Thank you very much. GOD BLESS. KEEP UP THE GOOD JOB.', \"Netflix is an excellent choice to streaming and it has a wide variety of choices. No matter what you're into, you'll find something to watch. I personally love the comedy specials.\", 'Netflix offers our family the flexibility to view a wide variety of movies, tv shows, documentaries, etc. There is something for the entire family!

      "['|Expedia is a disorganized misleading organization, that tells lies about their pricing. When they record their calls and tell you that the prices for the property you just booked at (By their own admission) has changed and that you would be refunded the difference, they try to make you go away by giving you a phony voucher not a refund, they have \\'zero\\' price guarantee, and they are a complete scam. Myself and eight other associates will never use them again.|We booked a 5-day vacation package to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico beginning 12/24/17, through Expedia. I made the arrangements & signed the deal on 10/24, 2 months earlier. The total was $3,700. I selected Spirit Airlines (stupidly, in hindsight) for a direct flight. I did see a message in small type that I selected a “low cost carrier” and therefore I may be liable for additional fees. However, I was not counting on $520 additional at the time of booking! When I checked-in online a few days prior to our flight I received the sticker-shock and almost fainted. There are 3 of us traveling, and so we each had to pay both checked and carry-on for 3 people (less the carry on for my son), and all of that came to $520.|Now, I have never purchased tickets thru Spirit, so I was unaware of these exorbitant fees. However, my beef is not with Spirit, jerks they might be, rather I am disgruntled with Expedia since they specialize in the travel industry and they knew there were 3 of us traveling and they should have sent us a more prominent alert (not in legalese small type) that we risk significant extra fees - far more than other airlines. If this were the 1990s and I went to a storefront travel agency and they failed to warn me (or said something like, “oh btw don’t forget possible extra baggage fees”) that I’d likely have to pay over $500 more I’d consider that malpractice. Anyway, I contacted Expedia by phone and direct text and the bottom line is “sorry”. I would have hoped they could meet me half-way or at least given me credits as a goodwill gesture. I’m very disappointed and learned not to use any of these on-line 3rd party travel agents. It’s a tough lesson-learned!|Please reconfirm with your customers the bed configuration before confirming the booking. How do you expect 3 person to sleep in a queen bed or in 2 separate single beds??? I am working in a hotel and I don\\'t see any problems with Agoda or any other third party websites or travel agents but it\\'s always Expedia who is the cause of most of the complaints in my workplace and I\\'m telling you, it is on a daily basis for Goodness\\' sake! Pls don\\'t just think about the profit! Think of your customers!|I paid $500 for hotel reservation and then discovered the dates were wrong, I asked Expedia to fix the dates which both dates were for 1.5 months later in from the time of booking. First they wasted 2 hours of my time on the phone and then 3 days later they sent me an email saying we cannot cancel the reservation. I replied I did not ask for cancellation I just want to fix the dates. They replied well first we have to cancel it then book for new date. So that is how they scam and rob people.|A year ago I booked to travel to New York and I paid for cancellation insurance full amount, then something medical came up for my wife and I had to cancel the trip. Expedia insurance said you need to provide a doctor\\'s note, so I did after a month they said we are not eligible for the refund and they provided some silly explanation. Then again, I paid for cancellation insurance and that is how treated that. Please stay away from these group if you don\\'t want no headache and financial cost.|We booked a $4,281.47 all-inclusive vacation to Antigua through Expedia from 2/9/16-2/16/16. We were informed by Expedia in the early hours of 2/9 that our flight out from JFK Airport later that day was cancelled due to a snowstorm. We were told that there would be no flights available to Antigua until February 13th-14th - more than halfway into our booked vacation. The Expedia agent explained that she would take care of everything. Her advice was to cancel the trip to Antigua and rebook, through Expedia, another $4,000 vacation to Cancun for February 12. Unfortunately, Expedia charged for both trips and would NOT REFUND the cost of the original trip on the basis that we canceled the trip. We are now out $4,281.47. We are open to receiving a credit for another vacation. Our letter to Expedia has been unanswered.|I am silver + member of Expedia and have booked many hotels using Expedia and I’ve got to know that they’ve been cheating me the whole time. This time I booked a hotel via Expedia and paid an amount of 85$ and I’ve asked my friend just to enquire as new customer how much the room was then we’ve got to know that room was only 64$ and next day I tried to book another room in same hotel and found the price as 104$. But upon checking with front desk they said that room rent is only 68$, I know Expedia should charge a fraction amount as service charge but almost 40$ is definitely not a service charge. I am not going to book via Expedia anymore, Priceline is way better than Expedia.|Expedia is full of crap, they knew we could not travel to PR and our money was not refunded. My coworker got a full refund from Expedia and she did not purchase insurance. Make your own travel arrangements. Don\\'t use Expedia.|I have purchased round-trip tickets for my family on November 4th to Lihue from PDX, and I paid $3,569.06. Two days before our return trip, we tried to confirm our tickets, and we learned that Island Air had gone bankrupt on November 10th, yet Expedia failed to notify us. We lost these two connecting flights which would have taken us back home. We stayed on the phone for over four hours with Expedia “customer service” in Manila just to learn that Expedia would not refund any money for these flights, and they did not offer us any other flight in exchange. They asked to leave a day earlier or later, even though we prepaid our accommodations, and changing our return date would have resulted in a loss of money.|Expedia services blamed customer Air, which was the only connecting flight which had not been cancelled for the return trip, and when we called Alaska Air, they stated that they were not to blame because we did not purchase tickets from them. Besides the extremely long wait times, they kept putting us on hold to “clarify” things, and they have not done anything to support our return home. Finally, we had to buy new tickets for our family through Hawaiian airlines out of pocket, which cost us $492.80. We asked Expedia to provide the same tickets to us instead of Island Air, and they told us that the same tickets were $960, but that “they will sell it to us for $760.”My husband and I were frantically on the computer, trying to find flights back home, and luckily, we purchased “cheaper” tickets than they offered to sell us. I feel cheated in many ways: first, they did not notify us when Island Air went bankrupt, even though they sold us tickets. Second, they did not find substitute flights back home, and third, they offered much higher prices for the tickets than what we found ourselves online. The incident spoiled the end of my vacation, and I am extremely unsatisfied.|I have been a loyal customer of Expedia for many years. If everything goes well Expedia is no better nor worse than the others. Essentially they sell you a ticket and say see ya later! I recently purchased a trip with the Travel Insurance they push (Travel Guard). I waited till 21 days out to purchase the airfare to ensure all would go well. The venue was cancelled the next evening. I contacted Expedia the next day and they would not help as I was on the 30 hour mark - they only care up to 24 hours. They then tried to cancel my travel insurance instead of my airfare. That was slimy but I chalked it up to miscommunication/language barrier. Travel Guard then denied my claim. The fine print doesn\\'t cover the venue being cancelled (or trip cancellations for pretty much any reason but death/hospitalization).|I am very disappointed - and Travel Guard should be ashamed. Based on their claim denial, and Expedia\\'s unwillingness to make this right just 30hrs after purchasing airfare tickets (Holding fast to the 24hr window), I must conclude that your Travel Insurance is a major scam. This is EXACTLY what travel insurance portrays itself to be for - unforeseeable changes in trip plans outside of your control. I cannot control when a business venue is canceled. No, I did not change my plans - the conference was cancelled altogether. I now have learned that AIG is the parent company for Travel Guard - the same insurance company that the People bailed out 10 years ago to the tune of $85B. Scam us once, shame on you. Scam us twice - shame on us for helping you back on your feet again. We do not forget.This is just so sad that Expedia/TravelGuard would stoop this low. I have been a loyal consumer of Expedia for a long time, but you have lost me as a customer due to this sleaziness. All for a measly $342. Travel Insurance is no different than any other - In the long run the Insurance company comes out ahead - that\\'s call business and profit. We stand behind that. But denying claims in every way feasible and clinging to useless fine print is unforgivable. Please just go away and leave room for respectable companies. Travel Guard gives insurance companies a bad image as a whole. I give this company a Negative star rating!|I just recently booked a studio with Expedia. The website advertised it at $75, I received a $273.14 charge on my card for property fees and deposit. I called Expedia to cancel this reservation immediately, I was told to contact the property manager directly, the problem is that the number they have is incorrect, they are using the 1 you have to dial to get an out of area call as part of the phone number. I have called several times to try to get this resolved and they still cannot help, they keep telling me to contact the incorrect number. I am so frustrated, I am currently on the phone for 1 hour and 15 minutes waiting for answers, my next step is to contact my credit card company and report fraud charges.|We are here at the airport SFO. Our flight was booked from Expedia, United-las Vegas-Panama-Peru (Copa). When we arrived to United our confirmation number did not show any booking or itinerary. They sent us to Copa. We went to Copa and they said they cannot.help because they are.not United. We spoke we Expedia and they do not help us. We are screw. I paid extra money business class and Expedia did not honor that. We were talking with a lady and then pass us to her supervisor \"Sophie\". At this point I really do not know even is that her real name. How is possible Expedia step on our rights? They are careless about it. My husband is handicap, and they do not care about it. Not solution. Does.someone can help? This is so stressful.|Expedia spelled my name wrong so I was forced to pay $50 to get on my flight for name change. I emailed them 3 days ago and no reply. I suggest, and from now on I will, just use the site as a catalogue and reach the companies directly. Use them like they use us. Plus you Do not have to deal with any third party issues to get a refund or change anything. I travel many times a year and have used Expedia for years. Not happening anymore.|We book a trip to Puerto Rico. (We meaning my wife, 3 kids, sister and sister in law). The planning and booking of the trip seemed fine. Puerto Rico is hit with 2 storms, the 2nd one being the most tragic. That 2nd storm hit a week prior to our departure so we contact Expedia to find out if the trip is canceled or what steps should be taken from there. The hotel cancels our reservations and our money is returned with no problems. After contacting the Airlines we were told we had to go through Expedia to find a solution. |At this time Puerto Rico has no power and the place is in a very bad state. We requests our money back and that became an issue due to Expedia stating the plane never canceled the flight. We were given credits which we had to use within 6 months. We were told we could use the credits whenever wherever as long as it was used prior to the 6 months. We have been contacting Expedia the last 2 days and I\\'ve been on the phone a total of 6 hrs. I feel like they do not want to help and they would rather the situation not work out so that they can keep the money. Why when we have no control over a situation such as the storm that hit do we get penalized? Do they want us to fly over there with 3, 8, 9 year old kids and look at a disaster, have no power, food etc. I don\\'t understand why Expedia will not back anyone up in a situation like this. With having important jobs, kids having school we can not just come and go as we please. I feel like I\\'m being scammed out of my money after trying to book a separate trip using the credits that were forced upon us. I\\'ve spoken with supervisors that are no help to the situation, everyone is trained to say the same thing. I guess I\\'ll have Expedia tell me when I can use my credits and they can plan my trip. This whole situation is horrible and I wish Expedia would correct the situation and not try to get more money out of us. I will be recording my next few attempts at contacting them.|Not sure why y\\'all are giving us a hard time cancelling our flight and refund my money. I have been fighting with y\\'all for over a month. Now saying I can\\'t fly because of certain reasons. And your customer service rep told me we would get a full refund on the tickets when we purchased if things come up. Because when I got the tickets I wasn\\'t sure if we was able to go. Not only that but we paid for insurance plan for cancellation. And also I have a doctor\\'s note now saying I have limited restrictions. Which means I can\\'t fly due to what I have because it too complicated for me to sits for a long period of time. Y\\'all are a SCAM to take $1000 away from someone who has a medical condition.|Get Away from Expedia! They are cheating people using a fake travel protection. They are charging people extra payment during booking as a Full Protection/ Free Cancellation and never refund any payment if you need to cancel, I am contacting them from 07-Nov-2017 and after more than 40 days they send me a letter, \"Please be advised that we contacted the airline today.

I got all the way to the end of confirmation of flights and an error came up and asked me to try again in a few moments. I continued to try over 10 or more times and it came up as the cc I was using wouldn\\'t go through. Then when I changed cc\\'s, it repeated the same. Kept telling me there was an error and to try again in a few moments. I continued to try until I gave up with the same error. I called Expedia and talked with someone who said neither CC would go through, with me knowing either or both should work.|I finally had to use a 3rd CC which only had enough on the limit to allow 2 people to travel, which meant I had to take the third person off, (they charged me more, saying the prices had gone up now) not allowing them to go on Xmas vacation with family (and it was his cc\\'s we were trying to use). I booked the other 2 travelers, leaving off the 3, not being able to go. Then... a fraud alert came to his CC\\'s telling him over 18k had been charged to his acct and he didn\\'t even get a ticket!!NOW, not only does he not get to go, but both of his CC\\'s were cancelled for fraud alert!! NOW... not only can he not go in family Christmas vacation, but he can\\'t use either CC\\'s because the banks closed them for fraud!! Now if he tries to book the trip, the prices have gone up SO much, he can\\'t pay this amount because he was in another state at a family funeral when his cards were cancelled and has to wait 10 days to get new cards and then it will be too late!!! He got charged over $18k and still has no ticket!!! Ridiculous!! Almost didn\\'t even make it home from Ca to Tx from family funeral because both cards were cancelled!!! Because of Expedia\\'s website, not only did the other two tickets go up (but were charged the original price and the most expensive price), but the CC owner was charged all that $ but still has no flight to Florida for Christmas!!!It\\'s so sad and we are all hurt that he won\\'t be there JUST because of Expedia!!! (He\\'s still working on the fraud charges and even after being charged the original prices, even the other two paid more!!! They charged the original price, and then charged the highest rate because they said the first charges didn\\'t go through, in fact they DID!!! UGH!!! I believe after ALL if this, they should give him a free ticket!!! He can\\'t even use his cards for Christmas gifts because of Expedia!!! Nor can he go on family Christmas vacation because his cards have been cancelled and the prices are outrageous now!!!Will Expedia make up for this loss? We all are hurt and frustrated over this. If the very first request had come up as completed, we would all be happy. They \"charged\" us, but we not only did not get the original price (even though they charged us), but the 3rd person doesn\\'t even get to go!!! SERIOUSLY!! $18k was charged to 2 credit cards but still no ticket??!! And now no credit cards!!! Expedia, please fix this wrong!! So sad.|USE FLIGHTHUB OR SOMEONE ELSE, DO NOT USE EXPEDIA. If we could give Expedia negative stars we would, We spent thousands on flights and we had to change a date and they had no options for us, they did not want to work with our situation and did not provide any alternatives. All of our money was lost because they were not willing to fix our problem. We highly suggest you give your business to other companies that are upfront and are willing to help, FLIGHTHUB has always provided us with the help we need.|I purchased ticket from Singapore to LAX travel date 12/14 to 1/16. Used XiamenAir Transit at Xiamen for 2 hrs and several mins. When I checked in they told me I have to have a visa on transit. Which never know visa is required only for transit. I understand if you want to leave the airport yes it required a visa. Been travel around the world. To make story short neither XiamenAir or EXPEDIA help. They bounced me on the phone for more than 1 hr. |I asked to refunded or transferred or give me credit. NO help. I was even willing to come back with a visa and requested to rescheduled with a fee. EXPEDIA DIDN’T want to help. Expedia even Said I don’t have # to Xiamen. I gave 2 different #. Now they said it was a wrong # or poor connection. You know I just talked to them prior so I know they’re Not doing their job. Bottom line, EXPEDIA IS MONEY SUCKER. DO NOT BUY TICKETS OR BOOK HOTEL through them. It was inhuman. No CONSIDERATION AT ALL. My $900 JUST BURNT LIKE THAT??? Also if you must travel through China never never transit at Xiamen. This world is so $$$ minded. No compassionate anymore???|I called Expedia to book a car rental in Ft. Lauderdale. I asked if I booked a rental with Economy, whether the reservation could be canceled if necessary and was assured by the representative that I could. I booked the car rental and paid. Several days prior to the pickup date, I had to cancel due to illness. I immediately contacted Expedia to cancel the reservation. I was put on hold for over 2 hours and then the representative hung up on me. I sent numerous emails stating I was canceling the reservation. An Expedia representative called me back at 2:00 am advising me I would have to obtain a medical note and submit it to Economy Car Rental. |I obtained a medical note from my doctor and submitted it to Expedia and Economy Car Rental. This was done several days prior to the reservation. It is now 12/13/2017 and Expedia has not issued a refund and when I called today I was told that Expedia has a no cancellation policy. This is a lie and false advertising. The representatives are rude and not helpful and each one tells you a different policy. I was told I would get a refund in three days and now they are refusing to issue a refund.|I literally made an account here just to submit this. I am disgusted with how this business has treated me. Spent over 6 hours on the phone over multiple occasions trying to resolve a huge issue that was because of incorrect information on their website. After everything including proof, they refuse to help out and blame me for their mistake. Very disappointed in how unprofessional this place is. Stay away.|I would like to start out and say that my husband and I have been using Expedia for the past 3 vacations. We have gone on and have had nothing but good experiences with their customer service and their fantastic prices. This vacation we booked just recently, however, has a different story. We decided on an all-inclusive resort in Los Cabos and it so happened that Expedia was advertising ‘Free Airport Transfers’ when you booked this bundle. When we went to check-out, the shuttle fee ($62) was not being waived. We called Expedia, the man on the phone was helpful and explained that he didn’t know why the fee wasn’t being waived, but if we booked through him, he would make sure we got our free shuttle. Great. So we booked with him over the phone, despite the fact that we get more money back (in Expedia points) when booking online.|The Expedia customer service man said he would contact our resort and arrange our transportation and email us when this was done. Great. I get an email saying that Expedia is in process of setting up our transportation and we will hear from them in 24 hours. Great. I get an email 3 DAYS later saying that the resort doesn’t do free shuttles and we are out of luck. I have NO problem with the resort we booked, this is all Expedia’s error. Expedia FALSELY advertised the free shuttle. Which is honestly fine with me, as long as they would make it right and pay for our shuttle.My husband proceeds to call customer service again. He was passed between 3 people and on the phone for 2 hours, 1.5 of those hours being on hold. The first customer service woman was helpful, apologized for their mistake and offered $100 credit on our account, but we would still need to pay the $62 for the shuttle. My husband kindly asked, \"Can you just please waive the shuttle fee.\" She transferred him to the next level. The next customer service guy wasn’t helpful at all and passed my husband to the next level.This woman at the next level accused my husband of lying about what the first customer service representative said (about the $100 credit) saying this wasn’t Expedia’s policy to do that. She told him there was nothing she could do and didn’t apologize for the false advertising on their website. The only offering she finally gave him was to send Expedia a detailed receipt of our taxi and they would refund us for ONE way, not both ways to and from the airport. HOWEVER, my husband then explained that in Mexico, you generally don’t get a receipt and we prefer the shuttle, as it feels safer. She continued to be rude, unhelpful and offer no solution.While this complaint is over a measly $62 dollars, it came down to the feeling that Expedia gave us. We have always loved booking our vacations through them because of the crazy bundle deals. Now, HOURS of our time have been wasted on the phone, and when we were able to talk to people, we were accused of lying. This might sound petty, but we will NEVER use Expedia again, because of how they treated us. Both my husband and I work in customer service orientated jobs and neither of us would talk to someone the way he was talked to. We just wanted someone to take care of this minor issue and in turn were treated extremely poorly.|We bought Vacation package with Expedia to Hawaii, this package was 100% refundable if cancelled within 24hrs. We cancelled within 24hrs, but Expedia only returned flight portion amount and they never returned hotel portion. After calling Expedia multiple times, each time I was put on hold for 30 min and finally Expedia would inform they managed to cancel hotel. Till today I havent received my money back, finally I called credit card company and filed dispute.|Expedia is worthless with re to solving problems via phone and email.

They played with many times; one time claiming that the airline company is responsible for the delay, which was not true since the cancellation was made within the first 24 hours. Then they claimed that the problem is in the bank, then I made a 3 way call and the bank emphasized that they did not hold any transaction from Expedia, because, simply, there was none. In the last call, and after they finished all the games they have, they said that I should wait up to 8 weeks to be refunded.|I was on this site and was purchasing 2 tickets, it came up with an ad saying I could reduce the price by $100.

Now I have a stupid credit card I don\\'t want and I had to buy the tickets through a different site, for the original price that Expedia offered me.

Myself and eight other associates will never use them again.\", 'We booked a 5-day vacation package to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico beginning 12/24/17, through Expedia. I made the arrangements & signed the deal on 10/24, 2 months earlier. The total was $3,700. I selected Spirit Airlines (stupidly, in hindsight) for a direct flight. I did see a message in small type that I selected a “low cost carrier” and therefore I may be liable for additional fees. However, I was not counting on $520 additional at the time of booking! When I checked-in online a few days prior to our flight I received the sticker-shock and almost fainted. There are 3 of us traveling, and so we each had to pay both checked and carry-on for 3 people (less the carry on for my son), and all of that came to $520.', 'Now, I have never purchased tickets thru Spirit, so I was unaware of these exorbitant fees. However, my beef is not with Spirit, jerks they might be, rather I am disgruntled with Expedia since they specialize in the travel industry and they knew there were 3 of us traveling and they should have sent us a more prominent alert (not in legalese small type) that we risk significant extra fees - far more than other airlines. If this were the 1990s and I went to a storefront travel agency and they failed to warn me (or said something like, “oh btw don’t forget possible extra baggage fees”) that I’d likely have to pay over $500 more I’d consider that malpractice. Anyway, I contacted Expedia by phone and direct text and the bottom line is “sorry”. I would have hoped they could meet me half-way or at least given me credits as a goodwill gesture. I’m very disappointed and learned not to use any of these on-line 3rd party travel agents. It’s a tough lesson-learned!', \"Please reconfirm with your customers the bed configuration before confirming the booking.

So that is how they scam and rob people.', \"A year ago I booked to travel to New York and I paid for cancellation insurance full amount, then something medical came up for my wife and I had to cancel the trip.

We were told that there would be no flights available to Antigua until February 13th-14th - more than halfway into our booked vacation. The Expedia agent explained that she would take care of everything. Her advice was to cancel the trip to Antigua and rebook, through Expedia, another $4,000 vacation to Cancun for February 12. Unfortunately, Expedia charged for both trips and would NOT REFUND the cost of the original trip on the basis that we canceled the trip. We are now out $4,281.47.

But upon checking with front desk they said that room rent is only 68$, I know Expedia should charge a fraction amount as service charge but almost 40$ is definitely not a service charge.

Two days before our return trip, we tried to confirm our tickets, and we learned that Island Air had gone bankrupt on November 10th, yet Expedia failed to notify us. We lost these two connecting flights which would have taken us back home. We stayed on the phone for over four hours with Expedia “customer service” in Manila just to learn that Expedia would not refund any money for these flights, and they did not offer us any other flight in exchange. They asked to leave a day earlier or later, even though we prepaid our accommodations, and changing our return date would have resulted in a loss of money.', 'Expedia services blamed customer Air, which was the only connecting flight which had not been cancelled for the return trip, and when we called Alaska Air, they stated that they were not to blame because we did not purchase tickets from them. Besides the extremely long wait times, they kept putting us on hold to “clarify” things, and they have not done anything to support our return home. Finally, we had to buy new tickets for our family through Hawaiian airlines out of pocket, which cost us $492.80. We asked Expedia to provide the same tickets to us instead of Island Air, and they told us that the same tickets were $960, but that “they will sell it to us for $760.”My husband and I were frantically on the computer, trying to find flights back home, and luckily, we purchased “cheaper” tickets than they offered to sell us. I feel cheated in many ways: first, they did not notify us when Island Air went bankrupt, even though they sold us tickets. Second, they did not find substitute flights back home, and third, they offered much higher prices for the tickets than what we found ourselves online. The incident spoiled the end of my vacation, and I am extremely unsatisfied.', \"I have been a loyal customer of Expedia for many years. If everything goes well Expedia is no better nor worse than the others. Essentially they sell you a ticket and say see ya later! I recently purchased a trip with the Travel Insurance they push (Travel Guard). I waited till 21 days out to purchase the airfare to ensure all would go well. The venue was cancelled the next evening. I contacted Expedia the next day and they would not help as I was on the 30 hour mark - they only care up to 24 hours. They then tried to cancel my travel insurance instead of my airfare. That was slimy but I chalked it up to miscommunication/language barrier. Travel Guard then denied my claim. The fine print doesn't cover the venue being cancelled (or trip cancellations for pretty much any reason but death/hospitalization).\", \"I am very disappointed - and Travel Guard should be ashamed. Based on their claim denial, and Expedia's unwillingness to make this right just 30hrs after purchasing airfare tickets (Holding fast to the 24hr window), I must conclude that your Travel Insurance is a major scam. This is EXACTLY what travel insurance portrays itself to be for - unforeseeable changes in trip plans outside of your control. I cannot control when a business venue is canceled. No, I did not change my plans - the conference was cancelled altogether. I now have learned that AIG is the parent company for Travel Guard - the same insurance company that the People bailed out 10 years ago to the tune of $85B. Scam us once, shame on you. Scam us twice - shame on us for helping you back on your feet again. We do not forget.This is just so sad that Expedia/TravelGuard would stoop this low. I have been a loyal consumer of Expedia for a long time, but you have lost me as a customer due to this sleaziness. All for a measly $342. Travel Insurance is no different than any other - In the long run the Insurance company comes out ahead - that's call business and profit. We stand behind that. But denying claims in every way feasible and clinging to useless fine print is unforgivable. Please just go away and leave room for respectable companies. Travel Guard gives insurance companies a bad image as a whole. I give this company a Negative star rating!\", 'I just recently booked a studio with Expedia.

That 2nd storm hit a week prior to our departure so we contact Expedia to find out if the trip is canceled or what steps should be taken from there.

We have been contacting Expedia the last 2 days and I've been on the phone a total of 6 hrs. I feel like they do not want to help and they would rather the situation not work out so that they can keep the money. Why when we have no control over a situation such as the storm that hit do we get penalized? Do they want us to fly over there with 3, 8, 9 year old kids and look at a disaster, have no power, food etc. I don't understand why Expedia will not back anyone up in a situation like this. With having important jobs, kids having school we can not just come and go as we please. I feel like I'm being scammed out of my money after trying to book a separate trip using the credits that were forced upon us. I've spoken with supervisors that are no help to the situation, everyone is trained to say the same thing. I guess I'll have Expedia tell me when I can use my credits and they can plan my trip.

We have gone on and have had nothing but good experiences with their customer service and their fantastic prices. This vacation we booked just recently, however, has a different story. We decided on an all-inclusive resort in Los Cabos and it so happened that Expedia was advertising ‘Free Airport Transfers’ when you booked this bundle. When we went to check-out, the shuttle fee ($62) was not being waived. We called Expedia, the man on the phone was helpful and explained that he didn’t know why the fee wasn’t being waived, but if we booked through him, he would make sure we got our free shuttle. Great. So we booked with him over the phone, despite the fact that we get more money back (in Expedia points) when booking online.', 'The Expedia customer service man said he would contact our resort and arrange our transportation and email us when this was done. Great. I get an email saying that Expedia is in process of setting up our transportation and we will hear from them in 24 hours. Great. I get an email 3 DAYS later saying that the resort doesn’t do free shuttles and we are out of luck. I have NO problem with the resort we booked, this is all Expedia’s error. Expedia FALSELY advertised the free shuttle. Which is honestly fine with me, as long as they would make it right and pay for our shuttle.My husband proceeds to call customer service again. He was passed between 3 people and on the phone for 2 hours, 1.5 of those hours being on hold. The first customer service woman was helpful, apologized for their mistake and offered $100 credit on our account, but we would still need to pay the $62 for the shuttle. My husband kindly asked, \"Can you just please waive the shuttle fee.\" She transferred him to the next level. The next customer service guy wasn’t helpful at all and passed my husband to the next level.This woman at the next level accused my husband of lying about what the first customer service representative said (about the $100 credit) saying this wasn’t Expedia’s policy to do that. She told him there was nothing she could do and didn’t apologize for the false advertising on their website. The only offering she finally gave him was to send Expedia a detailed receipt of our taxi and they would refund us for ONE way, not both ways to and from the airport. HOWEVER, my husband then explained that in Mexico, you generally don’t get a receipt and we prefer the shuttle, as it feels safer. She continued to be rude, unhelpful and offer no solution.While this complaint is over a measly $62 dollars, it came down to the feeling that Expedia gave us. We have always loved booking our vacations through them because of the crazy bundle deals. Now, HOURS of our time have been wasted on the phone, and when we were able to talk to people, we were accused of lying. This might sound petty, but we will NEVER use Expedia again, because of how they treated us. Both my husband and I work in customer service orientated jobs and neither of us would talk to someone the way he was talked to. We just wanted someone to take care of this minor issue and in turn were treated extremely poorly.', 'We bought Vacation package with Expedia to Hawaii, this package was 100% refundable if cancelled within 24hrs.

I feel like I was scammed into getting their credit card, what the heck. I'm so disappointed. I will be filing a consumer complaint with the BBB and contacting my credit report agencies and disputing the credit card effect on my report. This just is bad business. Don't fall for it. Barclay is the credit card.\", \"DO NOT BOOK THROUGH EXPEDIA!!! I tried to book online and it wouldn't let me through! Later, I found out that I was charged for the flight times 2. When I called customer service they put me on hold over an hour only to ask me did I purchase insurance! ARE YOU KIDDING ME, I NEVER SUBMITTED FOR Y'ALL TO TAKE MY PAYMENT. They said possible glitch in the system but I'm still stuck with two tickets I don't need!!!\"]\n"

      "['|I subscribed to Match.com in June 2017. I had a discounted rate through Groupon, and knew I did not want to be auto-renewed, especially at the normal rate. Upon subscribing, I followed the FAQ steps on Match to make sure my account would not be auto-renewed by cancelling my subscription. My subscription expired on 12/29/17 and auto-renewed at $119 inexplicably.|I called the Match customer service two times on 1/2/18 to explain the situation. I was told that their system did not show I cancelled the membership and was asked if I had an email confirmation. At the time, I could not find the email, but I told both representatives I was telling the truth and cancelled back in June 2017, and my conscience would not let me lie if I truly forgot to cancel on my own. They told me the best they could do would be to refund me $60, and informed me I would not be able to speak with a manager. They then proceeded to end the call when I was not satisfied with only being refunded half, since I should not have been charged at all.After those two calls, I searched through my email and finally found the email confirmation dated 6/28/17 showing that I successfully cancelled my membership. I then called back and spoke with a third Match.com representative and informed her that I found my email. She placed me on hold and looked up my account information. She then informed me she could see I cancelled my account on 6/28/17; however, she indicated I reactivated my account the following day on 6/29/17.This is very troubling for a few reasons: 1) I never reactivated my account. She said it\\'s not as simple as mistakenly clicking the \"reactivate\" link in the email and that several steps would have been taken. I had no reason to reactivate the account the following day because I knew I absolutely did not want to renew, which is why I was proactive and cancelled my membership. 2) The first two customer service representatives informed me that they could not see on their end any cancellation that previously occurred. It was not until I finally found the email confirmation and spoke to the third representative did they inform me that they could see the cancellation that was previously made.I informed the third representative that I did not reactivate my account and informed her I never received an email confirming my reactivation, since they previously informed me they needed my cancellation email. She then placed me on hold, and then informed me that they do not send email confirmations for reactivations after I asked for one. This is very troubling because the first two representatives informed me that I needed to have the email confirmation for the cancellation, which at the time, I could not provide. Then, when I finally found the email, I was then told that I reactivated my account, but Match.com does not send email confirmations for that. So Match.com is holding customers to a standard that they themselves do not hold themselves to as far as providing email documentation.In conclusion, I subscribed to Match.com in June 2017. I knew I did not want to auto-renew once the subscription expired, so I was proactive and followed the steps to cancel my membership upon the expiration date of 12/29/17. I was provided an email confirmation of my cancellation dated 6/28/17. I was subsequently charged an auto-renewal fee of $119. I called and spoke with two representatives who informed me the only thing they could do was refund me $60, since their system showed I never cancelled my membership, and I could not provide the email confirmation of the cancellation at the time. I finally found the email confirmation of the cancellation minutes later and called back and spoke with a third representative.Unlike the previous two representatives, she informed me she could see in the system that I cancelled the membership on 6/28/17 (which the previous two representatives failed to mention), but she then indicated that I auto-renewed the following day on 6/29/17. I absolutely did not auto-renew, as I immediately knew upon subscribing that I did not want that to happen, which is why I cancelled. Each representative informed me they could only refund me $60, and informed me that I could not speak with a manager because the manager would relay the same message.I am very troubled by this situation, as I have never been treated like this by a company before. I feel like I was scammed out of the remainder of the $119 charged to my credit card and was deceived by the customer service agents who did not inform me of their knowledge of the initial cancellation. I have an email confirmation confirming my cancellation, which shows I was telling the truth. Now, I\\'m being told I reactivated my account, which is completely false. The only way this issue can be resolved is to receive a complete refund for the $119 that I am owed and would like assistance with making this right. I am an honest person, and I feel like I was completely scammed with this situation.|The automatic renewal is very tricky to cancel and the customer service does not make any exceptions for the multiple barriers that the company sets up to bar cancelling the membership. Once it renews, the company will not pro-rate cancellation. I attempted to cancel numerous times but the website either kept crashing or did not provide confirmation of the cancellation.|\"Matchmaking\" business: Some of the profiles offered to members may not be associated with this site, may have never been associated with the site (just gave their profile at the beginning and never signed up), or may no longer be affiliated with this site. Members have no way of telling, and are not told either at signup, or during the tenure of membership.|They have an \"automatic membership renewal\" system. So, if you want out, complaints, or run into a perennially incompetent customer service, no matter how soon after joining, they WILL NOT REFUND ANY OF YOUR MONEYS, will simply promise \"not to automatically review\". The internet reflects tens of thousands of complaints in similar situations. They know and are fully aware of the problem. Yet, they intentionally accept membership signups with the full expectation and intention that those common problems are likely to or will occur, and that no refunds will be given. Customers have no clue of what they are getting into. Fraud???|Earlier this year I had tried Match.com out for one month and paid the full $42.99 charge for the month. I had no success, so I decided to cancel considering how expensive the monthly cost was. In June, a 6 month promotional deal was released for around $4/month. I decided I\\'d give it another shot. Shortly after, I started seeing someone in August. From that point on, I didn\\'t use any dating applications. In September, I had remembered I needed to cancel my account and subscription and made countless attempts to log in, with no success. I clicked the \"forgot my password\" button and was informed an email was sent. Days went by and no email was received, including my junk mail. I tried this 15+ times over the course of the last several months, still with no success.|After reviewing my credit card statement on 12/28 I found a $59.94 charge on my account from Match.com on 12/26. This was accompanied by a phone number. After explaining the situation to a billing specialist, I was informed that someone had hacked into my account and changed the login information. It had been over three months since this had happened and it was the first time I was being informed. They refused to refund the $59.94 charge because I didn\\'t \"cancel my subscription\". How would I be able to cancel my subscription if you allowed someone to hack into my account and never notify me of the instance. I\\'d say 15+ attempts is more than enough effort on my end to cancel my subscription. I will never use Match.com again and recommend you do the same. I\\'m very disappointed with their lack of account security and their unreasonable charges for an unusable \"hidden\" account.|Sent email offering $7.79 per month for 6 months, so $46.74 total. Plus an additional 35% off. So $32.72 total. At checkout total is $71.57. I assume this is illegal in the US. I certainly would not trust such a company with any info.|I originally signed up for a 6 month membership and was well aware of their auto-renew policy and knew my membership would have auto-renewed in December. I intentionally made sure I cancelled my membership in November, received a confirmation number and a message stating that I could still use my account up until the expiry date. I had my profile hidden as I had met someone and no longer had a need to be on the site.|Today I noticed a $157 charge on my Amex card. When I contacted the Match \"customer service\" they said that I only cancelled my \"add-ons\" back in November. I didn\\'t have add-ons on my account. When I told them this, the first \"customer service\" agent disconnected with me. I had to go through the whole conversation again with another \"customer service\" agent who only agreed to refund me one month. Based upon what I am hearing from others, this is their scam. Completely unethical. I have no idea how my \"auto-renew\" was turned back on since I myself did not access my account settings after November. I have no recourse to get my money back and consider this a very expensive mistake.|I deactivated the account and selected cancel and was still charged. Customer service will dispute your charges and provide bogus reasons you can’t receive a full refund. If you disagree they will hang up. The site is a bunch of crap. The same people always populate in a search and half the accounts are deactivated that do populate. There is nothing free. It’s free to put up a picture of yourself. There is no free communication not even during the trial period! Match.com is crap!|I haven’t been on Match for probably 8 years now and still receive constant emails from them even though account cancelled and unsubscribed. Women still send me messages, so unfortunately Match just uses a bunch of old inactive accounts to pad their numbers.|I am at a complete loss of words for the quality of customer service that Match.com offers. I had only used their services for one week and noticed that my account was on auto renewal for the past six months. I have been charged twice in the amount of $65 since I had last used it and when I called to report this innocent mistake, I was told no refund is possible, there is no manager to speak to and the system won’t allow for any other changes. This is an absolute outrage. After trying to understand and get information from the rep, she says that she is not able to help me further and then hangs up on me. I have never had an experience like this before in my life. Even Amazon refunds when someone is unaware of an auto renewal and doesn\\'t hang up on you. Apparently, their policy is to not help you and then steal money from you. This is not OK. I do not recommend this service to ANYONE if you care about your hard earned money.|I had stopped using this site months before the \"auto renew\" date, and had at the onset of my initial subscription turned the auto-renew option OFF. They DO NOT send out any kind of warning/ reminder/ nudge that your subscription is almost about to be renewed. I didnt think it mattered since mine was supposedly turned OFF. But, oh boy, still got charged $130+ anyways. I got online and cancelled the entire account THE SAME DAY they tried to charge me (and I ONLY knew about it because my Credit Card co sent me a possible fraud alert, or I would not have known otherwise!).|THEY STILL CHARGED ME! Then I had to call customer service, and they still refused to refund me - EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY and was no longer using their services! AND I was not supposed to be auto-renewed to begin with!! After much hassle, the lady said she could refund HALF of my amount! SO I was still charged over $70 for absolutely nothing. Terrible website! TERRIBLE customer service! Outraged at their \"policies\".|EVERY DAY I am told to change my password and my Facebook password. Every day I am told I have been hacked. NOBODY fixes my problem!!! Last Friday I was told to change my EMAIL address, which I did. Same thing happened. Have not been able to log in all weekend. I\\'ve been told a Supervisor will contact me but they never do. I have asked for a refund but never receive one. I am forwarding a copy of this email to the Better Business Bureau. If I cant use their site and nobody will help me and I cant reach a supervisor, I am asking for my money back. Absolutely no customer service!!!|Dating sites are all a bit sketchy, but I had thought Match different. Forgivable is their focus on physical traits that reinforce that only good-looking people get dates, but that is the world in which we live. Pardonable is their so-so performance on keeping scammers off the site - hard to catch such beasts. BE VERY WARY of anything involving money with them! They make it difficult to cancel subscription and they never reimburse you. They will lie to you about the opposite sex being interested in you to get you to sign up and then say, \"Sorry, we do not give you your money back ever\". Do not believe what they say and be very careful of ever giving them money - you can consider it gone. They would not reimburse me - even though I asked in a very polite/friendly manner for them to be reasonable.|Match.com sucks. Just read the other 2000 one star reviews. I should have came here before I wasted 60 dollars. All they are going to do is prey on people with low self esteem, the site is designed to basically not work. Don\\'t do it, you will still be alone but at least you will still have your money.|I just joined last night. After a bad experience with the first person I emailed with, I called this morning to get a refund. They refused saying because I sent 2 emails I could not get even a partial refund. So they\\'re keeping $131 for a 6 month subscription when I called to cancel in less than 24 hours.|Unfortunately, I have nothing good to say about my experience with Match.com. I was catfished but thankfully realized it rather quickly, had another experience where I ended up needing an Order of Protection filed against a guy who was harassing me, and then automatically charged after I hid my account because I didn’t realize I was on auto renewal. The company does not even offer partial refunds. There is no way to know who is actually really available on this site so you will waste your time looking through countless accounts that either will never receive your message or they are not even checking their profiles anymore. Although I chose this because I wasn’t interested in any hookups, it appears that that is what is the norm for most guys these days. I will never use this site again and am telling everyone to stay far away from Match and look elsewhere. It’s a scam. They just want your money.|After spending $60 on a six month subscription we were kicked off 24 hours later for openly admitting we are polyamorous and they only gave us a $9 refund. That\\'s a joke! No one has returned any of our phone calls we\\'ve only received emails, for being a large corporation the way they run things is pathetic. And I am writing reviews on any place I possibly can about this company. I fully intend to exploit it as much as possible. I hope the $50 was worth it!|I have been a member of Match for over a year and decided to give a 3 month trial a chance AGAIN!! Unable to log into account. Ask for link to reset. Never arrives. Fake profiles and unrealistic expectations. There is no guarantee for 6 month matches. Stay far away!!|I do not usually write reviews. This one is necessary. Match is a scam on several levels. There are an enormous number of fake profiles on the site that randomly \"Like\" and \"Favourite\" you before you pay. This gives you the incentive to pay and check out who liked your profile. When you do pay, the people who like you are all crap and fake. I verified this two different times with two different accounts over two years. They will claim that they cannot control these fake accounts and while that may be true to some extent, they are nowhere near the problem on any other dating app or site (Coffee Meets Bagel/Bumble/POF) for example.|Secondly and MOST importantly. When you join Match, you are enrolled in AUTO-PAY. This is the default setting and at the end of your term, they will re-bill you for the next term at least the same rate. The two times I did this, I CANCELLED autopay the DAY AFTER paying for my membership. That means that they cannot charge you again. The first time this happened, at the end of the 6 months, guess what? They billed me again. I called them and told them this has to be refunded, to which they replied that they can offer a partial refund for 1 month of service. I said I wanted a full refund but had to give up on this request after multiple rejections. So I believed that I somehow must have forgotten to cancel my membership.Fast forward to this year. I bought a 6 month membership. THIS TIME... I took a screenshot of the Autopay cancellation screen. I also saved the email confirmation that stated that I had successfully cancelled the Autopay. Fast forward to last week. They billed me for another 6 months. I called them (and it took a while to find their number). I asked the guy to refund me. He said no. He could give me a partial refund for one month because there was no evidence I had cancelled. I told him that this sounded extremely familiar but this time I had a screenshot of the cancellation page. He asked for a confirmation number for cancellation. I read him the entire email from 6 months earlier where Match confirmed I cancelled. No confirmation number. Then I looked the email he JUST send me to give me a partial refund and... YOU GUESSED IT... ALSO had no confirmation.HE KNEW I could not have had a confirmation number because THEY DO NOT GIVE ONE BY EMAIL. I told him to send me to a supervisor. He responded he could not there was no supervisor there. He also said he could not give a full refund because there was no way to do that. I told him this was fraud twice and that he was getting me angry. I told him to refund the cost or I would take legal action even if the action cost me 10 times more than the Match payment. He put me on hold. Not sure why since there was supposed to be no supervisor. And when he returned everything was refunded. These people are perpetual liars and cheats. His name was Jose by the way in case you get him. Press him for your refund. I hope this helps someone.|I\\'ve been on the site for close to 3 months. Most of the responses I\\'ve received are from FREE members who are NOT able to communicate with you but only allowed to like your pictures or send a wink. Any other members that contacted me could not speak English and from another country.|Signed up for Match. They took my money and then never sent me a single email. I complained and canceled service. Match continued to charge me until I caught it. Told me something was wrong with my email. Nothing is wrong with my email. I never had problems with anyone else. I made three payments and never got one bit of service. They said it was my fault. They are scumbags. Never do business with thieves.|I joined Match and have tried to find women to be friends with or a relationship. I have had over 145 views and I have messaged them all. I had one respond to one thing that was auto generated then their profile was gone then the picture changed. I had another message me back. Talked for about 2 weeks. Texting our cell phones then she asked for a prepaid credit card stating she could not buy one where she lives but where she said she lived and where her phone # was located where 2 totally different places and she would not answer any questions. I asked or would not give out any detail where she lived but wanted to meet.|When she went to visit her mom she kept asking about the credit card. I took a picture of one to show I could get one. She wanted one for 200 which seems to be the number everyone asks for. So I could not get a $200 card so I got $100 card. I asked for a video chat before I took pictures of the card to give her and she got very mad trying to guilt me into sending it without checking on her. She then said to keep it and put it behind us then 2 days later she started asking for it again so I did. I had spent it and that was the end of us talking. But I have had one other message me back well within the area for a hookup to be told I was not close enough to her. So my experiences with dating companies is not very good. Save your money. You will find someone on your own.|Downloaded their app and all of a sudden... I was freaking charged $115 for a 6-month subscription. Not sure how that happened. I know the first thing they sent me to when I used their app was this \"please join to view\" page. I don\\'t remember clicking on anything. Instead, I exited that screen yet somehow I\\'m now a paid member? WTH. I did try out their 1 week trial for $3 or something so they must have kept my PayPal info. I clearly do not want to pay $100+ to join this site when FB is FREE!|First they sent female matches then matches far older then my account was compromised and other photos and leads from North Carolina. I asked for help. Nothing. I asked for cancellation. They told me do it myself. I asked for partial refund. They refused. I have heard other horror stories. STAY AWAY.|I read all of Match.com’s information. Despite what they say I was harassed and feel it was a very negative experience. I called to request a refund. The rep was rude, unhelpful and refused to let me speak to a supervisor.|I had been a Match.com user for the past 4 years. While a paid subscriber, my profile generated pretty much no interest. Soon after my subscription would expire, I start receiving emails from Match saying \"this person is interested in you\", \"you had ** number of views\", \"this person liked you\", \"this person rated you a \"YES\" in their daily matches\" etc. But they would never show you who may be interested unless you renew your subscription. Ultimately really piquing my curiosity, so I end up renewing. Only to find the person was either fake, they weren\\'t really interested, or I would message them, and would never hear back. It seems Match.com is ONLY set up so that the only way people can possible converse or meet is if BOTH people are paid subscribers. I messaged several who were reported by Match.com to be interested, but never heard a word from any of them. |\\n                \\n                    \\n                \\n                    \\n                        During this last time, same thing, I received NOTHING while I was a paid subscriber. But within a week of my subscription running out, suddenly people are supposedly interested in me AGAIN! Not this time Match! You\\'ve taken my money enough times to know your site is a scam, and you should have a class action lawsuit filed against you for deceptive practices!!! I had been a paid subscriber at least 4 or 5 times, maybe more, and each time the result was basically the same.I have never met one person via Match.com, never chatted with anyone via Match.com. But they claim their success rate is so successful! I call BS on that! The only thing Match.com has been successful at is taking more of my money.|The site is confusing and poorly organized. Even with my profile requirements listed I was getting emails from all over the US. I had several glitch experiences with the message section where I would check on one box and go to the bottom to delete selected messages and it deletes all messages with no way of getting them back. I have had at least two experiences where two people were sharing one profile. I\\'ve had experiences where I responded to a recent messages and the site says those profile isn\\'t available due to some kind of scam related issue. Their customer service people are dreadful and robotic. I was on the site for a week (had signed up for 3 months because they offered a big discount) and they refused to refund my money even with verification of all the problems! Don\\'t use this dating site.|I signed up for a one month membership. And before I could even search and reply to profiles I was banned. Now there\\'s no activity on my account. No weird photos or creep messages. Instead I get a link to backgroundcheck.com. They never checked my background because I don\\'t have a criminal record. I complained to the BBB to no avail. Please stay away from this site.|I\\'ve been a member, on and off, since 2003. Constantly making changes to the site format, few if any that improve its usability. The opposite, if anything. Constantly implementing hoaky, hair-brained gimmicks and \"features\" to soak more money out of you. Popular with the naive and gullible, not with experienced users who know better. Any effort or system that used to be in place to screen for scammers went out the window years ago. STILL implement the absurd \"Wink\" and \"Like\" program. Right when adults in our society are more immature and juvenile than ever, they give a 30-, 40- or 50-year-old person the option of contacting another grown adult by \"hiding\" behind a button that you click. Now they even have a \"Yes\" rating. It\\'s like we\\'re 12-years-old playing a video game in an arcade. How lazy and insulting can you get? \"Wow, you like me enough to click a button.\" It\\'s no wonder why the dating and relationship world is in the state that it is.|Now, they have pre-scripted profiles that you can choose from, if you\\'re too lazy or \"un-unique\" to write a good one yourself. Problem is, everyone uses them now and it\\'s absurdly obvious. So it\\'s basically a slide show of who\\'s attractive and who\\'s not. And everyone still wants to be treated like they\\'re unique and special. Just another thing to encourage laziness. Crazy. In conflicts, women always get the upper hand and the men get their profiles deleted because it\\'s women\\'s photos that draw men to the site. Kind of like at a bar. No cover charge for hot women and/or free drinks. If you choose or have to make a new profile, you can\\'t use an e-mail address or credit card that you\\'ve already used. You actually have to go out and get a new e-mail account AND credit card JUST TO SIGN UP ON MATCH.COM. Downward spiral.|I canceled my membership auto-renew months ago. I stopped receiving emails from them at that time. Today I noticed my bank account balance seemed lower than it should be, so I went online to check, and Match.com auto-renewed me again anyway. I opened a customer service chat with them and they demanded a cancellation number, which they never sent to me months ago when I turned off auto-renew on their site. Run away from this ripoff company as fast as you can.|I had unsubscribed once but realized I still had 2 months left so I let it go. I made sure I unsubscribed again so I wouldn\\'t be charged on my credit card. Lo and behold I checked my statement and I was charged for the month again after I had unsubscribed again. I. called my credit card company to complain. They stopped the payment and gave me a credit. So later I find out that Match has blocked me permanently from the site because of THEIR error or should I say unethical scam! I complained to Match about this but to no avail. After reading all the reviews about this deceitful site I\\'m glad I\\'m permanently blocked! Someone should take legal action against them!']\n"

I had no reason to reactivate the account the following day because I knew I absolutely did not want to renew, which is why I was proactive and cancelled my membership. 2) The first two customer service representatives informed me that they could not see on their end any cancellation that previously occurred. It was not until I finally found the email confirmation and spoke to the third representative did they inform me that they could see the cancellation that was previously made.I informed the third representative that I did not reactivate my account and informed her I never received an email confirming my reactivation, since they previously informed me they needed my cancellation email. She then placed me on hold, and then informed me that they do not send email confirmations for reactivations after I asked for one. This is very troubling because the first two representatives informed me that I needed to have the email confirmation for the cancellation, which at the time, I could not provide. Then, when I finally found the email, I was then told that I reactivated my account, but Match.com does not send email confirmations for that. So Match.com is holding customers to a standard that they themselves do not hold themselves to as far as providing email documentation.In conclusion, I subscribed to Match.com in June 2017. I knew I did not want to auto-renew once the subscription expired, so I was proactive and followed the steps to cancel my membership upon the expiration date of 12/29/17. I was provided an email confirmation of my cancellation dated 6/28/17. I was subsequently charged an auto-renewal fee of $119. I called and spoke with two representatives who informed me the only thing they could do was refund me $60, since their system showed I never cancelled my membership, and I could not provide the email confirmation of the cancellation at the time. I finally found the email confirmation of the cancellation minutes later and called back and spoke with a third representative.Unlike the previous two representatives, she informed me she could see in the system that I cancelled the membership on 6/28/17 (which the previous two representatives failed to mention), but she then indicated that I auto-renewed the following day on 6/29/17. I absolutely did not auto-renew, as I immediately knew upon subscribing that I did not want that to happen, which is why I cancelled. Each representative informed me they could only refund me $60, and informed me that I could not speak with a manager because the manager would relay the same message.I am very troubled by this situation, as I have never been treated like this by a company before. I feel like I was scammed out of the remainder of the $119 charged to my credit card and was deceived by the customer service agents who did not inform me of their knowledge of the initial cancellation. I have an email confirmation confirming my cancellation, which shows I was telling the truth. Now, I\\'m being told I reactivated my account, which is completely false. The only way this issue can be resolved is to receive a complete refund for the $119 that I am owed and would like assistance with making this right. I am an honest person, and I feel like I was completely scammed with this situation.', 'The automatic renewal is very tricky to cancel and the customer service does not make any exceptions for the multiple barriers that the company sets up to bar cancelling the membership. Once it renews, the company will not pro-rate cancellation. I attempted to cancel numerous times but the website either kept crashing or did not provide confirmation of the cancellation.', '\"Matchmaking\" business: Some of the profiles offered to members may not be associated with this site, may have never been associated with the site (just gave their profile at the beginning and never signed up), or may no longer be affiliated with this site. Members have no way of telling, and are not told either at signup, or during the tenure of membership.', 'They have an \"automatic membership renewal\" system. So, if you want out, complaints, or run into a perennially incompetent customer service, no matter how soon after joining, they WILL NOT REFUND ANY OF YOUR MONEYS, will simply promise \"not to automatically review\". The internet reflects tens of thousands of complaints in similar situations. They know and are fully aware of the problem. Yet, they intentionally accept membership signups with the full expectation and intention that those common problems are likely to or will occur, and that no refunds will be given. Customers have no clue of what they are getting into. Fraud???', 'Earlier this year I had tried Match.com out for one month and paid the full $42.99 charge for the month. I had no success, so I decided to cancel considering how expensive the monthly cost was. In June, a 6 month promotional deal was released for around $4/month. I decided I\\'d give it another shot. Shortly after, I started seeing someone in August. From that point on, I didn\\'t use any dating applications. In September, I had remembered I needed to cancel my account and subscription and made countless attempts to log in, with no success. I clicked the \"forgot my password\" button and was informed an email was sent. Days went by and no email was received, including my junk mail. I tried this 15+ times over the course of the last several months, still with no success.', 'After reviewing my credit card statement on 12/28 I found a $59.94 charge on my account from Match.com on 12/26. This was accompanied by a phone number. After explaining the situation to a billing specialist, I was informed that someone had hacked into my account and changed the login information. It had been over three months since this had happened and it was the first time I was being informed. They refused to refund the $59.94 charge because I didn\\'t \"cancel my subscription\". How would I be able to cancel my subscription if you allowed someone to hack into my account and never notify me of the instance. I\\'d say 15+ attempts is more than enough effort on my end to cancel my subscription. I will never use Match.com again and recommend you do the same. I\\'m very disappointed with their lack of account security and their unreasonable charges for an unusable \"hidden\" account.', 'Sent email offering $7.79 per month for 6 months, so $46.74 total. Plus an additional 35% off. So $32.72 total. At checkout total is $71.57. I assume this is illegal in the US. I certainly would not trust such a company with any info.', 'I originally signed up for a 6 month membership and was well aware of their auto-renew policy and knew my membership would have auto-renewed in December. I intentionally made sure I cancelled my membership in November, received a confirmation number and a message stating that I could still use my account up until the expiry date. I had my profile hidden as I had met someone and no longer had a need to be on the site.', 'Today I noticed a $157 charge on my Amex card. When I contacted the Match \"customer service\" they said that I only cancelled my \"add-ons\" back in November. I didn\\'t have add-ons on my account. When I told them this, the first \"customer service\" agent disconnected with me. I had to go through the whole conversation again with another \"customer service\" agent who only agreed to refund me one month. Based upon what I am hearing from others, this is their scam. Completely unethical. I have no idea how my \"auto-renew\" was turned back on since I myself did not access my account settings after November. I have no recourse to get my money back and consider this a very expensive mistake.', 'I deactivated the account and selected cancel and was still charged. Customer service will dispute your charges and provide bogus reasons you can’t receive a full refund. If you disagree they will hang up. The site is a bunch of crap.

There is no free communication not even during the trial period! Match.com is crap!', 'I haven’t been on Match for probably 8 years now and still receive constant emails from them even though account cancelled and unsubscribed. Women still send me messages, so unfortunately Match just uses a bunch of old inactive accounts to pad their numbers.', \"I am at a complete loss of words for the quality of customer service that Match.com offers. I had only used their services for one week and noticed that my account was on auto renewal for the past six months. I have been charged twice in the amount of $65 since I had last used it and when I called to report this innocent mistake, I was told no refund is possible, there is no manager to speak to and the system won’t allow for any other changes. This is an absolute outrage. After trying to understand and get information from the rep, she says that she is not able to help me further and then hangs up on me. I have never had an experience like this before in my life. Even Amazon refunds when someone is unaware of an auto renewal and doesn't hang up on you. Apparently, their policy is to not help you and then steal money from you. This is not OK. I do not recommend this service to ANYONE if you care about your hard earned money.\", 'I had stopped using this site months before the \"auto renew\" date, and had at the onset of my initial subscription turned the auto-renew option OFF. They DO NOT send out any kind of warning/ reminder/ nudge that your subscription is almost about to be renewed. I didnt think it mattered since mine was supposedly turned OFF. But, oh boy, still got charged $130+ anyways. I got online and cancelled the entire account THE SAME DAY they tried to charge me (and I ONLY knew about it because my Credit Card co sent me a possible fraud alert, or I would not have known otherwise!).', 'THEY STILL CHARGED ME! Then I had to call customer service, and they still refused to refund me - EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY and was no longer using their services!

If I cant use their site and nobody will help me and I cant reach a supervisor, I am asking for my money back. Absolutely no customer service!!!\", 'Dating sites are all a bit sketchy, but I had thought Match different. Forgivable is their focus on physical traits that reinforce that only good-looking people get dates, but that is the world in which we live. Pardonable is their so-so performance on keeping scammers off the site - hard to catch such beasts. BE VERY WARY of anything involving money with them! They make it difficult to cancel subscription and they never reimburse you. They will lie to you about the opposite sex being interested in you to get you to sign up and then say, \"Sorry, we do not give you your money back ever\". Do not believe what they say and be very careful of ever giving them money - you can consider it gone. They would not reimburse me - even though I asked in a very polite/friendly manner for them to be reasonable.', \"Match.com sucks. Just read the other 2000 one star reviews.

I was catfished but thankfully realized it rather quickly, had another experience where I ended up needing an Order of Protection filed against a guy who was harassing me, and then automatically charged after I hid my account because I didn’t realize I was on auto renewal. The company does not even offer partial refunds. There is no way to know who is actually really available on this site so you will waste your time looking through countless accounts that either will never receive your message or they are not even checking their profiles anymore. Although I chose this because I wasn’t interested in any hookups, it appears that that is what is the norm for most guys these days. I will never use this site again and am telling everyone to stay far away from Match and look elsewhere. It’s a scam. They just want your money.', \"After spending $60 on a six month subscription we were kicked off 24 hours later for openly admitting we are polyamorous and they only gave us a $9 refund.

Fake profiles and unrealistic expectations. There is no guarantee for 6 month matches. Stay far away!!', 'I do not usually write reviews. This one is necessary. Match is a scam on several levels. There are an enormous number of fake profiles on the site that randomly \"Like\" and \"Favourite\" you before you pay. This gives you the incentive to pay and check out who liked your profile. When you do pay, the people who like you are all crap and fake. I verified this two different times with two different accounts over two years. They will claim that they cannot control these fake accounts and while that may be true to some extent, they are nowhere near the problem on any other dating app or site (Coffee Meets Bagel/Bumble/POF) for example.', 'Secondly and MOST importantly. When you join Match, you are enrolled in AUTO-PAY. This is the default setting and at the end of your term, they will re-bill you for the next term at least the same rate. The two times I did this, I CANCELLED autopay the DAY AFTER paying for my membership. That means that they cannot charge you again. The first time this happened, at the end of the 6 months, guess what? They billed me again. I called them and told them this has to be refunded, to which they replied that they can offer a partial refund for 1 month of service. I said I wanted a full refund but had to give up on this request after multiple rejections. So I believed that I somehow must have forgotten to cancel my membership.Fast forward to this year. I bought a 6 month membership. THIS TIME... I took a screenshot of the Autopay cancellation screen. I also saved the email confirmation that stated that I had successfully cancelled the Autopay. Fast forward to last week. They billed me for another 6 months. I called them (and it took a while to find their number). I asked the guy to refund me. He said no. He could give me a partial refund for one month because there was no evidence I had cancelled. I told him that this sounded extremely familiar but this time I had a screenshot of the cancellation page. He asked for a confirmation number for cancellation. I read him the entire email from 6 months earlier where Match confirmed I cancelled. No confirmation number. Then I looked the email he JUST send me to give me a partial refund and... YOU GUESSED IT... ALSO had no confirmation.HE KNEW I could not have had a confirmation number because THEY DO NOT GIVE ONE BY EMAIL. I told him to send me to a supervisor. He responded he could not there was no supervisor there. He also said he could not give a full refund because there was no way to do that. I told him this was fraud twice and that he was getting me angry. I told him to refund the cost or I would take legal action even if the action cost me 10 times more than the Match payment. He put me on hold. Not sure why since there was supposed to be no supervisor. And when he returned everything was refunded. These people are perpetual liars and cheats. His name was Jose by the way in case you get him. Press him for your refund. I hope this helps someone.', \"I've been on the site for close to 3 months.

She wanted one for 200 which seems to be the number everyone asks for. So I could not get a $200 card so I got $100 card. I asked for a video chat before I took pictures of the card to give her and she got very mad trying to guilt me into sending it without checking on her. She then said to keep it and put it behind us then 2 days later she started asking for it again so I did. I had spent it and that was the end of us talking.

Ultimately really piquing my curiosity, so I end up renewing. Only to find the person was either fake, they weren\\'t really interested, or I would message them, and would never hear back. It seems Match.com is ONLY set up so that the only way people can possible converse or meet is if BOTH people are paid subscribers.

Any effort or system that used to be in place to screen for scammers went out the window years ago. STILL implement the absurd \"Wink\" and \"Like\" program. Right when adults in our society are more immature and juvenile than ever, they give a 30-, 40- or 50-year-old person the option of contacting another grown adult by \"hiding\" behind a button that you click.

I again went through the return process and was told that they would schedule a FEDEX pickup. This has not happened. Today I got an email stating that they haven’t received the return yet and that they will not refund my money until they get it by a certain date which is 3 days from now. This was the absolute worst online experience that I have had and will never shop Walmart.com again and will find it difficult to shop Walmart at all!|I walk into WalMart near my hometown (Raceland, La). I walked by a bunch of Mardi Gras junk and went to \"Automotive\" to buy a gallon of no-freeze windshield wiper cleaning fluid. NONE! They were sold out! Don\\'t they know when it is winter time what they should have more of in stock? NO. Why are you people so ** S-T-U-P-I-D? Also, a bunch of registers, but only ONE was open? I have seen people getting so pissed off about the cash registers, they went down the nearest aisle, filled up their basket. Push it to a closed cash register, LEAVE it there and walk out!

The item I received was a completely different brand and didn\\'t even have comparable features (Smart TV, HDTV). I then started the process of returning the Item via my online account. It indicated I could take it to the nearest store for the quickest resolution. We packed up the TV and went into the local Walmart customer service. After standing in line, I asked the lady if I could just exchange it for the actual TV I was supposed to have received. She said sure and told us to leave the incorrect TV there and go back to electronics to see if they had the correct one in stock.|A gentleman there found the last TV of the same model I purchased and brought it to Customer Service for us to the front of the line. The now different lady behind the counter argued and said we just cut in front of everyone else in the line. We showed her the TV that we left up there and that we had already stood in line. She was very irritated but then also didn\\'t know how to handle the exchange.There was a young gentleman that assisted, but overall I had to argue with both of them about it being an exchange and that I shouldn\\'t have to pay anything different. They said they had to refund the original purchase with a gift card and then use the gift card to purchase the TV I already purchased on sale. Of course they were charging me the current price and not the sale price I originally paid. When I finally got them to realize that I wasn\\'t going to pay the current price, the young man overrode the charge and put in the sale price. While that was all fine and good, they indicated that they would have to charge me more for tax which I didn\\'t understand since the purchase online should have been the correct amount of tax for where they were sending my TV which was the same zip code as the Walmart store to which I was returning it. The young man said he couldn\\'t override the tax, so I agreed to pay the difference. So if that wasn\\'t enough of a headache, I decided I would try to contact Walmart.com and Walmart online. Talk about being elusive, I sent an e-mail and they responded that I would have to contact the store manager. Then I went to the chat and all they told me was that the refund would be effective in 5-10 days. So neither format was useful in trying to get the simple answer to why I had to pay more for their mistake. Convenience, yes if you get the right product. Returns and exchanges, horrible. Although it would have been more inconvenient for me, I might have been better off just returning it by mail hoping they could send me the correct product, but then I would not have a product until another 7-10 days. I can\\'t fault the in store customer service for the incorrect product, but there seems to be a huge disparity between Walmart.com and Walmart stores.|On Walmart.com it said I wasn\\'t charged for a bracelet but a text from my card provider said otherwise. When calling them they tried to talk as if I was an idiot saying I wasn\\'t charged for it. I tried to tell them NetSpend could call and verify it was true but they didn\\'t give me $10 back.

Finally, Walmart contacted them on my behalf and as soon as they heard I wanted a refund, they dropped off the face of the Earth. How can companies like Walmart refuse to stand behind the items that they allow to be sold on their websites???|THIS IS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - ACTUALLY, IT\\'S ***NO*** CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am making it my mission to spread the word about Walmart and MODAMAD - Do not buy anything from them, if you have a problem you will be stuck with the product with no way to get your money back or even a credit.

Then my other older brother (age 22) went and they said that because his brothers were in recently and I was underage they wouldn\\'t sell to him either.|I am on a fixed income. Did online research for a Oster x large capacity countertop convection oven. Amazon.com offered said product for 79.00. Wal-Mart offered identical product for 89.00. According to Wal-Mart\\'s price match policy online it states they will price match as long as item is in stock in store and the website was last updated Dec 19, 2017.|When I went in store to purchase the item I contacted store management in Kings Canyon Fresno CA, & was told that they no longer price match anything other than Wal-Mart.com and that their policy changed in MAY of 2017. There is NO MENTION of any policy changes on the website. This oven was a necessity and now I\\'ve had to redirect money in my budget in order to cover the extra $10. I know that\\'s not a lot but it IS on a fixed income. Called corporate and all they could say was \"Sorry it\\'s our new policy.\" I told them they need to fix that on the website and they stated they will when they can and for me to have a nice day. Utterly disgusted!|After purchasing a Christmas tree in 2015 with a 5 year extended warranty, I put up the tree the following year, 2016, only to discover none of the lights worked. This is a 12-foot artificial tree and very heavy. I called the warranty company and they said they could not help me unless I send them the tree on my dime. That would have cost more than the tree itself. So I gave up.|2017 August 26, 2017 I purchased my 5th icemaker. The previous 4 had failed at 30 days almost exactly. With this one, I decided I would go ahead and try the extended warranty one more time. What a mistake! The icemaker failed after 33 days, exactly 3 days after Walmart\\'s return policy. I talked to Walmart and they said to call the warranty company as it was a known issue. The warranty company told me to contact the manufacturer issue. The Manufacturer had another company handle their warranty issues. The only way to talk to them is via their email which is: customerservice@curtisint.com.I contacted them and they took 3 days to send a claim number and asked me for photos of Model #., Serial #, and Receipt. They also wanted photos of my machine front and back. I sent the photos of the original machine but forgot photos of the front of the machine so I sent a stock photo. Keep in mind I sent my receipt, and photo of serial and model #. It took them 8 days to email me back and tell me they must have photos of the machine front and back. Now this is not a big deal, but I already packaged up the machine for return shipping as I am sure they will want me to send it back (again on my dime). They make you jump through so many hoops and take so long that I firmly believe they are hoping that we just give up. I would rate a negative 5 if I could.|Ol\\' Roy dog treats, multi-flavor biscuits, 15lb box. Purchased at Walmart on Dec. 2, 2017. Upon getting close to the bottom of the box I found multiple (about 8) biscuits adhered together by what appears to be the expanding spray stuff you use to fill in holes! See attached picture.|I own a pair of L gym gloves. I ordered another pair in L/XL size from Walmart.com. The gloves I received were tiny despite being labelled L/XL. I understand Walmart\\'s business model is based on selling substandard, fake, or damaged products at cheap prices. However, selling small size gloves as L/XL makes the product completely useless for me. Walmart return policy aims to make it as difficult as possible for me to get a full refund.|I placed an order on Walmart.com for some perfume on December 16th and received an email that indicated an estimated arrival time of December 21 to the store nearby me. After not receiving a confirmation email from Walmart letting me know that my product was ready for pick up, I decided to visit the local Walmart in Camillus, NY on December 23. They were nice enough to let me know that my product was in transit. They couldn\\'t tell me anything more but suggested I contact Walmart.com who could give me the tracking number. Why Walmart.com didn\\'t send me, the customer the tracking number from UPS is beyond me. I also don\\'t understand why the local Walmart wasn\\'t able to give me the same information that Walmart.com had which resulted in me having to contact Walmart.com.|I proceeded to call Walmart.com, and besides receiving the tracking number they were able to tell me that it looks as if the product I ordered on the 16th was going to arrive in the Camillus store on the 26th. They also told me that the product I ordered for my wife was actually in Syracuse as of 2:00am on the 23rd of December. When I called UPS to ask why it would take until Tuesday, the 26th to have my package delivered to the Walmart in Camillus, I was told that it could take up to 10 business days, and since this was a land package they don\\'t deliver on Sundays or holidays. Hence why my package won\\'t get to Walmart until this Tuesday, December 26. Merry Christmas!UPS was nice enough to let me know that Walmart.com did NOT transmit the order to UPS until three days later or December 19th. IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF TECHNOLOGY, THAT IS UNWARRANTED! Had Walmart.com processed the order right away, there would have been a good possibility that my wife\\'s package would have arrived on time.What bothers me the most is the breakdown in communications from Walmart.com. Never once did they indicate in the email I received with my order confirmation that the delivery could take up to 10 business days, nor did they offer me an option to expedite. For the right price I would have paid for quicker shipping or I would have gone to Amazon.com where I have NEVER had an issue with timely delivery. After reading some of the complaints on the Consumer Affairs website, it is clear to me that I am not the only one who has been impacted by poor communication. Needless to say this will be the LAST time I ever order something from Walmart.com. One more disappointed customer.|So I ordered a photo canvas online for my boyfriend for Christmas. I ordered a couple days before Christmas and the website said that my order would be ready in a day so I was like, \"Awesome. That was fast and easy!\" I get the email confirmation that my order was ready the very next morning at around 10:30 am and I go to the Walmart (they sent me to one 35 mins away even though theres one 5 mins away from me but whatever. I\\'m in a good mood. It\\'s Christmas!). I walk in. I ask them. They\\'re like, \"Nah sorry. The email sends when it SHOULD be ready. Not when it actually is. We can\\'t do anything about it.\"|So I was like, \"Eh it\\'s ok. It\\'s not your fault. You guys dont control the website.\" So I go on their online chat system and I talk to this guy. He says he is sorry. He\\'ll put mine on rush shipping and it\\'ll be ready in less than 24 hours and then he just disconnects the chat. So I\\'m like, \"Ok... weird but... less than 24 hours. Fine.\" So the next day no email. Day after I\\'m like, \"Ok I\\'ll call.\" They answer and say, \"No. No one put in for rush shipping. Your order isnt ready,\" aaaaand, \"The machine is broken.\" So I\\'m like, \"Ok. Fine. Can you guys just do a big poster then instead of a canvas.\" They say no and that I should get a refund and try other stores. Walmart\\'s a waste of time. I went to Walgreens and got an even bigger poster for sooooo much cheaper (I\\'m just going to frame it. Screw the canvas).|DO NOT BUY FROM WALMART.COM. Not all items walmart.com sells are from Walmart, rather they are from what they call ‘Marketplace’. These items are not refundable at Walmart stores. You will have to go through the hassle of contacting the manufacturer and returning any items directly to them at your expense, plus a 20% restocking fee! Walmart does not advise you of this when you place the order, and remove themselves of any responsibility if you have to return the purchases!!!|I used Walmart website photo services to order 6 custom calendars on Dec 15 2017. The website offered a few choices for delivery, I choose to have them delivered for free to my home rather than drive the 25 miles to the nearest store. The website claimed \"2 day shipping\" and I was supposed to receive them on Dec 21. My receipt confirmed the date. On Dec 22, I used the Chat function of the website to attempt to inquire about the status of my order, After being disconnected twice, waiting for over 20 minutes each time to get a response, and the website claiming less than a 5 minute wait, I was finally connected.|I was told that the order had not yet shipped. As these are intended as gifts, I inquired about switching the order to have it printed at the local store for same day pickup, and was told that I would have to reorder and pay for that as well. As of now I have received notice that the order would be here on 12/23, then 12/26, then 12/27 and now who knows when. The point is that it is after the holiday, the intended recipients will all have gone to their distant homes and Walmart doesn\\'t think that it is a problem. Their customer service is not in any way effective or empowered to actually assist in providing a solution and that the responses were uncaring and felt scripted. So much for an enjoyable holiday. Walmart, make it right. This is well beyond disappointment. I feel that this was false advertising on their part, and they have managed to completely ruin my Christmas.|I ordered a Christmas present for my aunt. I ordered it December 18. I paid $2.99 extra to have it \"guaranteed delivered by December 21st\". I go to check status, says it\\'ll be delivered Dec 26!! I contact Walmart which is huge pain, you have to \"chat\" with someone not well-versed in English. They give me an attitude and say, \"It\\'s the third-party vendor\\'s problem, contact them.\" I did! They said they don\\'t even OFFER expedited shipping! So obviously, Walmart is the one who screwed me over by promising expedited delivery for a fee! I try explaining this to another representative via chat. He promises me someone will look into this and email me within one business day. Guess what? One business day later, no reply. So I have my fiancé call them, because he\\'s better on the phone. All they say is it will be delivered Dec 26. No explanation for why it was promised Dec 21 or why it wasn\\'t delivered then. |After being on hold a while, he finally got them to agree to refund the fee for expedited shipping within 5 business days. I\\'ll be looking for it, but this sure doesn\\'t help my situation! Christmas is gonna come and I won\\'t have anything for my aunt. Thanks, Walmart. It just annoys me nobody has any idea why it wasn\\'t delivered when promised, and the vendor, Penny\\'s Needful Things, wasn\\'t very nice in their response, either. I never would\\'ve ordered this if I\\'d known I wouldn\\'t have it by Christmas! What is extra ridiculous is I checked the tracking and it says it was in Philadelphia (22 miles from my delivery address) at 1:15 pm yesterday. So...why on earth would it take until Dec 26 to get 22 miles? I\\'d rather just drive to pick it up, and get it in time! Of course that\\'s not an option. So disappointed.|I went Christmas shopping today for my grandchildren and went to pay for it and the cashier said my card was being denied. There is no reason for this as I made sure there was enough money on it before shopping. The total cost was $400. And a little change. Now that may not seem like a lot but it\\'s all I had enough to get for 7 granddaughters. Anyhow the cashier said let\\'s try it again and it was denied again. So I stepped aside to call about my account and it said I only had $74. In my account. This is not possible because before when I checked there was over $1000. |On my account. So I was taken to customer service where the lady checked the records for that register and she said it never went through. So my husband who was in another state called the bank and was told the problem was Walmart double charged me and there was no reason for it being rejected. After waiting for a call back from my husband I returned to the long line again to tell the lady what they said. She was not too happy and repeated what she said to me before that there was no charges taken from my card because it was denied. She called for someone by the name of Eric to double check it and he agreed with her. So I told my husband what they said and once again he called bank. The bank ended up calling the Walmart to speak with her. I waited and waited with nothing from this woman at all. Finally I asked her what the bank had to say, and she says they just asked a couple of questions and hung up. Not true, and she could have called me up to the desk again as I was off to the side waiting all this time (an hour and a half I waited for her to do nothing. With one of my granddaughters) she called an assistant manager on the phone and then told me there was nothing she could do. Well by this time my husband has called back to tell me that the bank tried talking to them and telling them that it shows they did in fact double charge me while telling me my card was being rejected. So now the bank will be filing a paper on it to fight this and I\\'m pretty mad as well as heartbroken that I don\\'t have gifts for my granddaughters for Christmas. I\\'m on disability due to MDS. And my husband is a truck driver so we don\\'t make a lot of money and had to wait until now to get present due to our situation. I have to say for as much as I shop at Walmart I\\'m pretty upset at the way this was handled as well as you have just ruined any happiness I would have had for the holidays.|I purchased a faulty DVD while on vacation at a Walmart store in Las Vegas on October 27th 2017. When I returned home I contacted Walmart many times about the faulty disc and have had no satisfactory response. They have asked me so many stupid questions. What size is the product? What do I use the product for? Ring the store? Can they not read that I live 6000 miles away? What a useless firm.|So in March this year, I purchased a television from Walmart, at the point of purchase I was introduced to a 3 year service plan warranty. Was explained that the service plan will cover my Tv for 3 years. If anything happened to the television, it will be repaired or replaced. I said why not, since I have young kids in my household anything is bound to happen, so gladly I included the service plan to my purchase. I was convinced that my television was covered, with that in mind I did not bother to read the fine print on the packet I was given. 9 months down the road accidentally the kids cracked the screen, I called the service plan customer care, to my dismay I was informed the warranty only covers electrical surge and electronic failure, quote and quote the warranty do not cover physical damage.|I am sitting here wondering why did I spend that extra cash to purchase the service plan warranty? And why was I not told that the service plan don\\'t cover physical damage. I think Walmart should be responsible to educate customers on the services that they provide, anyway buyer beware, before you purchase service plan ask about the fine print or you will be duped.|My son wanted Santa to bring him a kayak for Christmas. I searched online for the best price. Walmart had it. They had all the accessories to go with it as well. So on November 7 our 2 kayaks they were going to be delivered. December 12th for store pick up Highway 50 on potatoes. I can\\'t even tell you how many times I\\'ve called customer service. I have dealt with walmart.com, nobody can tell me why my kayaks have not came in so now December twentieth walmart holds my child\\'s Christmas in their hands, and nobody cares. As a matter of fact I can\\'t even get the potato store to answer their phone. |When you call customer service, it says 5 minute wait. 28 minutes later, someone answered, Well guess what my lunch break was over\". She had no idea that was what she told me. She did not know she could give me a refund, so do you think I really want a refund December twentieth. I do. I can\\'t say I\\'ll never shop at walmart again, but I can tell you I will never trust walmart ever again. Every time I see their commercials order today, free store pick up, it makes me want to vomit.|Ordered a hockey table. It came, was broken so called right away. Not Walmart fault it was. Token but the company that sold it. Walmart sent me another one. Great. But I call weekly to try and get the old one picked up. It\\'s very heavy and Walmart hires out a company to bring it and so I\\'d hope pick it up. Month later it\\'s still here. Sick of calling in hopes to get them to do something! Not even sure where to go from here. Sell it?|Had a nightmare at Walmart money store. A business friend at Salt Lake City Walmart sent funds to me via Walmart to Walmart and he emailed me the receipt. I went to pick up the funds, produced ID and noticed the person at Salt Lake City who keyed in the order did a typo, should have placed an L in my name but placed an I. I was at the Walmart store in Mililani Hawaii and asked for their help at the money store and spoke to their manager. I produced all docs to support the funds were to go to me and they refuse to help, they said needs to be fixed at Salt Lake City.|I called Salt Lake City Walmart and it was very difficult to get anyone who spoke decent English. I asked for a manager at the store and they refused to help me, did not want to talk with me and hung up on me, crazy rude. They hung up on me as I was in front of the manager at the Mililani, Hawaii store. I called back and asked for the manager to the money store at Salt Lake and finally got to this manager at their money store, and I was at the Walmart in Mililani on the phone at the same time. Their money store manager refused to accept their typo, he said he cannot make a change over the phone but all I wanted him to do was to pick up the hardcopy my friend filled in to send the money and check if in the name if his staff did a typo and input an I which should have been an L in my name. If so, fix the data in the computer so I can get the funds.He refused, refused to take responsibility, refused to talk to the manager at the Walmart I was at. I had all the necessary documentation, the sender’s info, my info and he said my friend has to go back in to the Salt Lake City store and fix (Walmart’s error). My friend is in biz, traveling, now he is on an airplane, traveling on biz, very disturbed at Walmart’s lack of common sense and lack of support. No one at Walmart wanted to take responsibility for their actions. Suggest: Walmart hire people who can speak and write English fluently, esp in handling money and entering anything into a computer. I called my friend to go back in to the store and he is gone... Now Walmart has the money and we cannot extract. I am done with Walmart money store, their level of incompetence is only exceeded by their lack of accepting responsibility for their actions and inactions.|Rude customer service rep. I went in and bought a 2 pack leggings. Got them home and it was only 1 pair not 2. I called to tell them and the lady said I should have seen it before I left the store so I have to drive 15 minutes again to fix the problem which means I’m going to be late for a important meeting that I bought them for.|Bought something for $22.60 with receipt. Went to get refund and they refunded only $21. I even asked if it is correct and the csm said yes. I prob still have the receipt. I know it\\'s only $1.60 but it not the first time they provided bad service.|I\\'m completely annoyed with this product, cheap Mainstay 3 wick candle, can only get one wick to burn, briefly and goes out, people work hard for their money. Very frustrated. A simple candle doesn\\'t function. Done with Walmart.|I went into the store to make a Christmas purchase. The sales associate and csm was very helpful and nice. I didn\\'t want my kids to see the purchase so I had my older child take the younger one into tune clothing section to pick out clothing that I also was going to purchase. 2 female associates working that department snatched the clothing out of my kids hands and scolded them. My children immediately came to tell me what happened I reported it to the csm that helped me and she called the assistant manager over named John. He was rude, nasty and very disrespectful in front in my children as they were describing the associates and telling him what happened. I will be contacting corporate for some of the things that he inappropriately said as well. I asked for a refund in which he acted as if he didn\\'t want to process.|We ordered a futon bed with bunk over it. The 1st one that was sent was lost in shipping. After over a month of waiting, we got our bed. The box was in very bad shape, holes in it & the bed was damage. Even a few parts were missing. When we called they said if we return it they will gives us a refund or they would give us a $10 gift card. We needed the bed for our company. Needless to say, we will not be ordering from Walmart again.|I tracked my order and the site said that it was delivered, yesterday. Nothing was delivered!! This is the second Walmart order that disappeared; the other NON- delivery was a few months ago. NO MORE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY.|The 1 Hour Photo Center of Walmart Superstore located at 13425 Community Road Poway, CA 92064 is the rudest and most inefficient 1 hour photo center I\\'ve ever used. I placed a custom Christmas cards order online with walmart.com 12/11/17. Received an email to confirm order and another email next day notifying order is ready to pick up. Also received two cell phone texts afterwards from Walmart to remind me of the pick up. I went to the photo center 12/13/17, the staff at the Poway Walmart photo center became impatient after he fumbled through all the drawers for almost 40 minutes and couldn\\'t locate my order. He grumbled and proclaimed the order either didn\\'t go through or still stuck in the \"order queue\" because they\\'re out of printing paper since yesterday.|I told him the texts I got show the cards are ready for pick up and he replied angrily that the texts are not from their photo center but from walmart.com and that they have nothing to do with the texts I received. He walked away expressionless without any apologies for the confusion between their online and local store. And I walked away without any cards or the knowledge of whereabouts of my cards. Even though I haven\\'t paid for the cards yet, I am very upset because the cards will contain my family pictures I uploaded to Walmart.com. Well, I guess it\\'s Walmart and I should expect too much. I am so done with their \"1 hour\" services.|WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AND I WILL MAKE SURE I NEVER SPEND ANOTHER PENNY IN THIS STORE!!!

We ordered a go kart on 11-27-17 online to be picked up at the store on 11-29-17 for a birthday gift 12-5-17 SO IT\\'S NOT A CHRISTMAS GIFT!! The birthday has come and gone and still no go kart so when I call every day I get the same ** excuse that it\\'s in transit or it was lost and reordered twice but still it\\'s lost in transit!

THEIR RESPONSE PRICELESS... All that I got was I\\'m sorry... Not once but numerous phone calls. I will assure you I will never spend another dime and I hope that people do their homework before ever making such a large online purchase!! So we had to cancel today 12-13-17 \\'cause they\\'re not sure when it comes out of transit, no-one has an answer, so we cancelled it so I can find my child another item from somewhere else...']\n"

I walked by a bunch of Mardi Gras junk and went to \"Automotive\" to buy a gallon of no-freeze windshield wiper cleaning fluid. NONE! They were sold out! Don\\'t they know when it is winter time what they should have more of in stock? NO. Why are you people so ** S-T-U-P-I-D? Also, a bunch of registers, but only ONE was open? I have seen people getting so pissed off about the cash registers, they went down the nearest aisle, filled up their basket. Push it to a closed cash register, LEAVE it there and walk out! I certainly cannot blame them! Again, \"Why are you people so ** S-T-U-P-I-D?', \"I purchased a television on Walmart.com during a great sale. The item I received was a completely different brand and didn't even have comparable features (Smart TV, HDTV). I then started the process of returning the Item via my online account. It indicated I could take it to the nearest store for the quickest resolution. We packed up the TV and went into the local Walmart customer service. After standing in line, I asked the lady if I could just exchange it for the actual TV I was supposed to have received. She said sure and told us to leave the incorrect TV there and go back to electronics to see if they had the correct one in stock.\", \"A gentleman there found the last TV of the same model I purchased and brought it to Customer Service for us to the front of the line. The now different lady behind the counter argued and said we just cut in front of everyone else in the line. We showed her the TV that we left up there and that we had already stood in line. She was very irritated but then also didn't know how to handle the exchange.There was a young gentleman that assisted, but overall I had to argue with both of them about it being an exchange and that I shouldn't have to pay anything different. They said they had to refund the original purchase with a gift card and then use the gift card to purchase the TV I already purchased on sale. Of course they were charging me the current price and not the sale price I originally paid. When I finally got them to realize that I wasn't going to pay the current price, the young man overrode the charge and put in the sale price. While that was all fine and good, they indicated that they would have to charge me more for tax which I didn't understand since the purchase online should have been the correct amount of tax for where they were sending my TV which was the same zip code as the Walmart store to which I was returning it. The young man said he couldn't override the tax, so I agreed to pay the difference. So if that wasn't enough of a headache, I decided I would try to contact Walmart.com and Walmart online. Talk about being elusive, I sent an e-mail and they responded that I would have to contact the store manager. Then I went to the chat and all they told me was that the refund would be effective in 5-10 days. So neither format was useful in trying to get the simple answer to why I had to pay more for their mistake. Convenience, yes if you get the right product. Returns and exchanges, horrible. Although it would have been more inconvenient for me, I might have been better off just returning it by mail hoping they could send me the correct product, but then I would not have a product until another 7-10 days. I can't fault the in store customer service for the incorrect product, but there seems to be a huge disparity between Walmart.com and Walmart stores.\", \"On Walmart.com it said I wasn't charged for a bracelet but a text from my card provider said otherwise.

Then my other older brother (age 22) went and they said that because his brothers were in recently and I was underage they wouldn't sell to him either.\", \"I am on a fixed income. Did online research for a Oster x large capacity countertop convection oven. Amazon.com offered said product for 79.00. Wal-Mart offered identical product for 89.00. According to Wal-Mart's price match policy online it states they will price match as long as item is in stock in store and the website was last updated Dec 19, 2017.\", 'When I went in store to purchase the item I contacted store management in Kings Canyon Fresno CA, & was told that they no longer price match anything other than Wal-Mart.com and that their policy changed in MAY of 2017. There is NO MENTION of any policy changes on the website. This oven was a necessity and now I\\'ve had to redirect money in my budget in order to cover the extra $10. I know that\\'s not a lot but it IS on a fixed income. Called corporate and all they could say was \"Sorry it\\'s our new policy.\" I told them they need to fix that on the website and they stated they will when they can and for me to have a nice day. Utterly disgusted!', 'After purchasing a Christmas tree in 2015 with a 5 year extended warranty, I put up the tree the following year, 2016, only to discover none of the lights worked. This is a 12-foot artificial tree and very heavy. I called the warranty company and they said they could not help me unless I send them the tree on my dime. That would have cost more than the tree itself. So I gave up.', \"2017 August 26, 2017 I purchased my 5th icemaker. The previous 4 had failed at 30 days almost exactly. With this one, I decided I would go ahead and try the extended warranty one more time. What a mistake! The icemaker failed after 33 days, exactly 3 days after Walmart's return policy. I talked to Walmart and they said to call the warranty company as it was a known issue. The warranty company told me to contact the manufacturer issue. The Manufacturer had another company handle their warranty issues. The only way to talk to them is via their email which is: customerservice@curtisint.com.I contacted them and they took 3 days to send a claim number and asked me for photos of Model #., Serial #, and Receipt. They also wanted photos of my machine front and back. I sent the photos of the original machine but forgot photos of the front of the machine so I sent a stock photo. Keep in mind I sent my receipt, and photo of serial and model #. It took them 8 days to email me back and tell me they must have photos of the machine front and back. Now this is not a big deal, but I already packaged up the machine for return shipping as I am sure they will want me to send it back (again on my dime). They make you jump through so many hoops and take so long that I firmly believe they are hoping that we just give up. I would rate a negative 5 if I could.\", \"Ol' Roy dog treats, multi-flavor biscuits, 15lb box. Purchased at Walmart on Dec. 2, 2017. Upon getting close to the bottom of the box I found multiple (about 8) biscuits adhered together by what appears to be the expanding spray stuff you use to fill in holes! See attached picture.\", \"I own a pair of L gym gloves. I ordered another pair in L/XL size from Walmart.com. The gloves I received were tiny despite being labelled L/XL. I understand Walmart's business model is based on selling substandard, fake, or damaged products at cheap prices. However, selling small size gloves as L/XL makes the product completely useless for me. Walmart return policy aims to make it as difficult as possible for me to get a full refund.\", \"I placed an order on Walmart.com for some perfume on December 16th and received an email that indicated an estimated arrival time of December 21 to the store nearby me. After not receiving a confirmation email from Walmart letting me know that my product was ready for pick up, I decided to visit the local Walmart in Camillus, NY on December 23. They were nice enough to let me know that my product was in transit. They couldn't tell me anything more but suggested I contact Walmart.com who could give me the tracking number. Why Walmart.com didn't send me, the customer the tracking number from UPS is beyond me. I also don't understand why the local Walmart wasn't able to give me the same information that Walmart.com had which resulted in me having to contact Walmart.com.\", \"I proceeded to call Walmart.com, and besides receiving the tracking number they were able to tell me that it looks as if the product I ordered on the 16th was going to arrive in the Camillus store on the 26th. They also told me that the product I ordered for my wife was actually in Syracuse as of 2:00am on the 23rd of December. When I called UPS to ask why it would take until Tuesday, the 26th to have my package delivered to the Walmart in Camillus, I was told that it could take up to 10 business days, and since this was a land package they don't deliver on Sundays or holidays. Hence why my package won't get to Walmart until this Tuesday, December 26. Merry Christmas!UPS was nice enough to let me know that Walmart.com did NOT transmit the order to UPS until three days later or December 19th. IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF TECHNOLOGY, THAT IS UNWARRANTED! Had Walmart.com processed the order right away, there would have been a good possibility that my wife's package would have arrived on time.What bothers me the most is the breakdown in communications from Walmart.com. Never once did they indicate in the email I received with my order confirmation that the delivery could take up to 10 business days, nor did they offer me an option to expedite. For the right price I would have paid for quicker shipping or I would have gone to Amazon.com where I have NEVER had an issue with timely delivery. After reading some of the complaints on the Consumer Affairs website, it is clear to me that I am not the only one who has been impacted by poor communication. Needless to say this will be the LAST time I ever order something from Walmart.com. One more disappointed customer.\", 'So I ordered a photo canvas online for my boyfriend for Christmas. I ordered a couple days before Christmas and the website said that my order would be ready in a day so I was like, \"Awesome. That was fast and easy!\" I get the email confirmation that my order was ready the very next morning at around 10:30 am and I go to the Walmart (they sent me to one 35 mins away even though theres one 5 mins away from me but whatever. I\\'m in a good mood. It\\'s Christmas!). I walk in. I ask them. They\\'re like, \"Nah sorry. The email sends when it SHOULD be ready. Not when it actually is. We can\\'t do anything about it.\"', 'So I was like, \"Eh it\\'s ok. It\\'s not your fault. You guys dont control the website.\" So I go on their online chat system and I talk to this guy. He says he is sorry. He\\'ll put mine on rush shipping and it\\'ll be ready in less than 24 hours and then he just disconnects the chat. So I\\'m like, \"Ok... weird but... less than 24 hours. Fine.\" So the next day no email. Day after I\\'m like, \"Ok I\\'ll call.\" They answer and say, \"No. No one put in for rush shipping. Your order isnt ready,\" aaaaand, \"The machine is broken.\" So I\\'m like, \"Ok. Fine. Can you guys just do a big poster then instead of a canvas.\" They say no and that I should get a refund and try other stores. Walmart\\'s a waste of time. I went to Walgreens and got an even bigger poster for sooooo much cheaper (I\\'m just going to frame it. Screw the canvas).', 'DO NOT BUY FROM WALMART.COM. Not all items walmart.com sells are from Walmart, rather they are from what they call ‘Marketplace’. These items are not refundable at Walmart stores. You will have to go through the hassle of contacting the manufacturer and returning any items directly to them at your expense, plus a 20% restocking fee! Walmart does not advise you of this when you place the order, and remove themselves of any responsibility if you have to return the purchases!!!', 'I used Walmart website photo services to order 6 custom calendars on Dec 15 2017. The website offered a few choices for delivery, I choose to have them delivered for free to my home rather than drive the 25 miles to the nearest store. The website claimed \"2 day shipping\" and I was supposed to receive them on Dec 21. My receipt confirmed the date. On Dec 22, I used the Chat function of the website to attempt to inquire about the status of my order, After being disconnected twice, waiting for over 20 minutes each time to get a response, and the website claiming less than a 5 minute wait, I was finally connected.', \"I was told that the order had not yet shipped. As these are intended as gifts, I inquired about switching the order to have it printed at the local store for same day pickup, and was told that I would have to reorder and pay for that as well. As of now I have received notice that the order would be here on 12/23, then 12/26, then 12/27 and now who knows when. The point is that it is after the holiday, the intended recipients will all have gone to their distant homes and Walmart doesn't think that it is a problem. Their customer service is not in any way effective or empowered to actually assist in providing a solution and that the responses were uncaring and felt scripted. So much for an enjoyable holiday. Walmart, make it right. This is well beyond disappointment. I feel that this was false advertising on their part, and they have managed to completely ruin my Christmas.\", 'I ordered a Christmas present for my aunt. I ordered it December 18. I paid $2.99 extra to have it \"guaranteed delivered by December 21st\". I go to check status, says it\\'ll be delivered Dec 26!! I contact Walmart which is huge pain, you have to \"chat\" with someone not well-versed in English. They give me an attitude and say, \"It\\'s the third-party vendor\\'s problem, contact them.\" I did! They said they don\\'t even OFFER expedited shipping! So obviously, Walmart is the one who screwed me over by promising expedited delivery for a fee! I try explaining this to another representative via chat. He promises me someone will look into this and email me within one business day. Guess what? One business day later, no reply. So I have my fiancé call them, because he\\'s better on the phone. All they say is it will be delivered Dec 26. No explanation for why it was promised Dec 21 or why it wasn\\'t delivered then. ', \"After being on hold a while, he finally got them to agree to refund the fee for expedited shipping within 5 business days. I'll be looking for it, but this sure doesn't help my situation! Christmas is gonna come and I won't have anything for my aunt. Thanks, Walmart. It just annoys me nobody has any idea why it wasn't delivered when promised, and the vendor, Penny's Needful Things, wasn't very nice in their response, either. I never would've ordered this if I'd known I wouldn't have it by Christmas! What is extra ridiculous is I checked the tracking and it says it was in Philadelphia (22 miles from my delivery address) at 1:15 pm yesterday. So...why on earth would it take until Dec 26 to get 22 miles? I'd rather just drive to pick it up, and get it in time! Of course that's not an option. So disappointed.\", \"I went Christmas shopping today for my grandchildren and went to pay for it and the cashier said my card was being denied. There is no reason for this as I made sure there was enough money on it before shopping. The total cost was $400. And a little change. Now that may not seem like a lot but it's all I had enough to get for 7 granddaughters. Anyhow the cashier said let's try it again and it was denied again. So I stepped aside to call about my account and it said I only had $74. In my account. This is not possible because before when I checked there was over $1000. \", \"On my account. So I was taken to customer service where the lady checked the records for that register and she said it never went through. So my husband who was in another state called the bank and was told the problem was Walmart double charged me and there was no reason for it being rejected. After waiting for a call back from my husband I returned to the long line again to tell the lady what they said. She was not too happy and repeated what she said to me before that there was no charges taken from my card because it was denied. She called for someone by the name of Eric to double check it and he agreed with her. So I told my husband what they said and once again he called bank. The bank ended up calling the Walmart to speak with her. I waited and waited with nothing from this woman at all. Finally I asked her what the bank had to say, and she says they just asked a couple of questions and hung up. Not true, and she could have called me up to the desk again as I was off to the side waiting all this time (an hour and a half I waited for her to do nothing. With one of my granddaughters) she called an assistant manager on the phone and then told me there was nothing she could do. Well by this time my husband has called back to tell me that the bank tried talking to them and telling them that it shows they did in fact double charge me while telling me my card was being rejected. So now the bank will be filing a paper on it to fight this and I'm pretty mad as well as heartbroken that I don't have gifts for my granddaughters for Christmas. I'm on disability due to MDS. And my husband is a truck driver so we don't make a lot of money and had to wait until now to get present due to our situation. I have to say for as much as I shop at Walmart I'm pretty upset at the way this was handled as well as you have just ruined any happiness I would have had for the holidays.\", 'I purchased a faulty DVD while on vacation at a Walmart store in Las Vegas on October 27th 2017. When I returned home I contacted Walmart many times about the faulty disc and have had no satisfactory response. They have asked me so many stupid questions. What size is the product? What do I use the product for? Ring the store? Can they not read that I live 6000 miles away? What a useless firm.', 'So in March this year, I purchased a television from Walmart, at the point of purchase I was introduced to a 3 year service plan warranty. Was explained that the service plan will cover my Tv for 3 years. If anything happened to the television, it will be repaired or replaced. I said why not, since I have young kids in my household anything is bound to happen, so gladly I included the service plan to my purchase. I was convinced that my television was covered, with that in mind I did not bother to read the fine print on the packet I was given. 9 months down the road accidentally the kids cracked the screen, I called the service plan customer care, to my dismay I was informed the warranty only covers electrical surge and electronic failure, quote and quote the warranty do not cover physical damage.', \"I am sitting here wondering why did I spend that extra cash to purchase the service plan warranty? And why was I not told that the service plan don't cover physical damage. I think Walmart should be responsible to educate customers on the services that they provide, anyway buyer beware, before you purchase service plan ask about the fine print or you will be duped.\", \"My son wanted Santa to bring him a kayak for Christmas. I searched online for the best price. Walmart had it. They had all the accessories to go with it as well. So on November 7 our 2 kayaks they were going to be delivered.

I have dealt with walmart.com, nobody can tell me why my kayaks have not came in so now December twentieth walmart holds my child's Christmas in their hands, and nobody cares. As a matter of fact I can't even get the potato store to answer their phone. \", 'When you call customer service, it says 5 minute wait. 28 minutes later, someone answered, Well guess what my lunch break was over\". She had no idea that was what she told me. She did not know she could give me a refund, so do you think I really want a refund December twentieth. I do. I can\\'t say I\\'ll never shop at walmart again, but I can tell you I will never trust walmart ever again. Every time I see their commercials order today, free store pick up, it makes me want to vomit.', \"Ordered a hockey table. It came, was broken so called right away. Not Walmart fault it was. Token but the company that sold it. Walmart sent me another one. Great. But I call weekly to try and get the old one picked up. It's very heavy and Walmart hires out a company to bring it and so I'd hope pick it up. Month later it's still here. Sick of calling in hopes to get them to do something! Not even sure where to go from here. Sell it?\", 'Had a nightmare at Walmart money store. A business friend at Salt Lake City Walmart sent funds to me via Walmart to Walmart and he emailed me the receipt. I went to pick up the funds, produced ID and noticed the person at Salt Lake City who keyed in the order did a typo, should have placed an L in my name but placed an I. I was at the Walmart store in Mililani Hawaii and asked for their help at the money store and spoke to their manager. I produced all docs to support the funds were to go to me and they refuse to help, they said needs to be fixed at Salt Lake City.', 'I called Salt Lake City Walmart and it was very difficult to get anyone who spoke decent English. I asked for a manager at the store and they refused to help me, did not want to talk with me and hung up on me, crazy rude. They hung up on me as I was in front of the manager at the Mililani, Hawaii store. I called back and asked for the manager to the money store at Salt Lake and finally got to this manager at their money store, and I was at the Walmart in Mililani on the phone at the same time. Their money store manager refused to accept their typo, he said he cannot make a change over the phone but all I wanted him to do was to pick up the hardcopy my friend filled in to send the money and check if in the name if his staff did a typo and input an I which should have been an L in my name. If so, fix the data in the computer so I can get the funds.He refused, refused to take responsibility, refused to talk to the manager at the Walmart I was at. I had all the necessary documentation, the sender’s info, my info and he said my friend has to go back in to the Salt Lake City store and fix (Walmart’s error). My friend is in biz, traveling, now he is on an airplane, traveling on biz, very disturbed at Walmart’s lack of common sense and lack of support. No one at Walmart wanted to take responsibility for their actions. Suggest: Walmart hire people who can speak and write English fluently, esp in handling money and entering anything into a computer. I called my friend to go back in to the store and he is gone... Now Walmart has the money and we cannot extract. I am done with Walmart money store, their level of incompetence is only exceeded by their lack of accepting responsibility for their actions and inactions.', 'Rude customer service rep. I went in and bought a 2 pack leggings. Got them home and it was only 1 pair not 2. I called to tell them and the lady said I should have seen it before I left the store so I have to drive 15 minutes again to fix the problem which means I’m going to be late for a important meeting that I bought them for.', \"Bought something for $22.60 with receipt. Went to get refund and they refunded only $21. I even asked if it is correct and the csm said yes. I prob still have the receipt.

Very frustrated. A simple candle doesn't function. Done with Walmart.\", \"I went into the store to make a Christmas purchase. The sales associate and csm was very helpful and nice. I didn't want my kids to see the purchase so I had my older child take the younger one into tune clothing section to pick out clothing that I also was going to purchase. 2 female associates working that department snatched the clothing out of my kids hands and scolded them. My children immediately came to tell me what happened I reported it to the csm that helped me and she called the assistant manager over named John. He was rude, nasty and very disrespectful in front in my children as they were describing the associates and telling him what happened. I will be contacting corporate for some of the things that he inappropriately said as well. I asked for a refund in which he acted as if he didn't want to process.\", 'We ordered a futon bed with bunk over it. The 1st one that was sent was lost in shipping.

Also received two cell phone texts afterwards from Walmart to remind me of the pick up. I went to the photo center 12/13/17, the staff at the Poway Walmart photo center became impatient after he fumbled through all the drawers for almost 40 minutes and couldn\\'t locate my order.

I\\'d like to see that capability expanded.|We recently got rid of our cable because we spent more time enjoying Netflix .

Yes Stranger Things, Lucifer, Orange is the new Black and many other great Netflix originals are on there, but a lot of movies are not. The fact that you sometimes miss one movie out of a movie trilogy is very annoying. Though understandable I feel like Netflix should just invest in the movies they buy. Don\\'t just buy the last movie that came out, buy the rights to all and leave them on for more than a month.|I live in a rural mountain area and that means no access to things like cable television or high speed internet and means  a long drive into the city to rent movies.    Thank goodness for Netflix!  I love them for being able to order movies on disk delivered to my mailbox and now that we finally have some almost decent internet, I have become hooked on their great original programming  -  Luther, Stranger Things, Frontier, The Crown and on and on.   We\\'ve been with Netflix since day one.   It\\'s the go-to in our house and a whole lot cheaper than pay-per-view on DirecTV.|My family has had Netflix for 8 years now and the only negative is they don\\'t have many of the classics. It\\'s hit and miss. Sometimes they\\'re there, but not for long. We could use more of them. Please!!|I have been a user of Netflix since 2006.  We love this service.  Now they have their own content such as MindHunter (an awesome per Criminal Minds series!!!). I highly recommend this streaming service.|I love movies but often the movie does NOT live up to the hype.  Sooooooo.... as soon as it comes out I add the title to my Netflix Queue.  See it within a few months of being in the theater.  Now to the Streaming, some good months some bad months.  But it does have a great selection of documentaries, foreign movies and canceled TV series.... Mixed bag but still lots cheaper then other alternatives.  But it does not offer as much as it once did.   So if you are thinking of subscribing get a mix of streaming and DVD.|And just like Neck Licks-Netflix is pure pleasure. The original series are some of the best entertainment to be found ANYWHERE!  There is always something to watch-its not a bunch of empty channels-you get far more than what you pay for!  If you cut the cord-as we have-and want to pay for just one entertainment resource, Netflix is the one to get.|Netflix has great  original programs. There is a huge sekection of genre to choose from. \\n\\nThe site is user friendly for the young and old.|What I really like about Netflix is the Original Programming! Series like \"Stranger Things\", \"Glitch\" and \"The Mist\"  make it worth having. A couple of things I don\\'t like is they take off Movies without warning, and they don\\'t have a lot of the newer TV Series and it takes forever to get new movies. And the cost of it has gone up very quickly! I was paying $8.99 (Which was a lot higher than my son\\'s price of $5.99 but ok, I was a little late to the party) Then in November 2016 it went to $9.99. Then 6 months later in May 2017 it went to $11.99. And now in November of 2017 it goes up  to $13.99 so I can have a small amount of shows in HD! I am rethinking the HD thing! So that is over 50% increase in 1 year! Maybe the new Disney Streaming Service will be less expensive. Or maybe Netflix will go down, since it is going to lose all Disney/Marvel/Star Wars movies when the Disney service goes on line (or maybe sooner!)|Netflix puts fresh excitement into watching. Being able to see foreign series and films, brand new comedy and the latest actors is a wow.The spectrum is  broad and the price puts all the commercial ones to shame. Can\\'t do without it.|Netflix is great if you like binge watching t.v. series. Not so many good movies. If your looking for t.v. without the contractually high cost then Netflix is perfect.|They give Good Service I like everything about Netflix They always take off the good shows and movies and leave you with a bunch of crappy ones that you\\'ve never even heard of.']\n"

Yes Stranger Things, Lucifer, Orange is the new Black and many other great Netflix originals are on there, but a lot of movies are not. The fact that you sometimes miss one movie out of a movie trilogy is very annoying. Though understandable I feel like Netflix should just invest in the movies they buy.

Series like \"Stranger Things\", \"Glitch\" and \"The Mist\"  make it worth having. A couple of things I don\\'t like is they take off Movies without warning, and they don\\'t have a lot of the newer TV Series and it takes forever to get new movies. And the cost of it has gone up very quickly! I was paying $8.99 (Which was a lot higher than my son\\'s price of $5.99 but ok, I was a little late to the party) Then in November 2016 it went to $9.99. Then 6 months later in May 2017 it went to $11.99. And now in November of 2017 it goes up  to $13.99 so I can have a small amount of shows in HD! I am rethinking the HD thing! So that is over 50% increase in 1 year! Maybe the new Disney Streaming Service will be less expensive. Or maybe Netflix will go down, since it is going to lose all Disney/Marvel/Star Wars movies when the Disney service goes on line (or maybe sooner!)', \"Netflix puts fresh excitement into watching. Being able to see foreign series and films, brand new comedy and the latest actors is a wow.The spectrum is  broad and the price puts all the commercial ones to shame.

The two internal flights were changed by more then 4 hours each, making it impossible to be on time for  my flight home. Expedia contacted me about the change.  I spent at least an hour on hold/speaking to a rep about the issue.  He was able to rebook the internal flights and told me the original flights would be refunded.  Then, I find the rebooked flights were cancelled due to my \"credit card not going through\", I called and again spent an incredible amount of time on hold and then spoke to a totally incompetent rep who finally got me to a supervisor.  The supervisor took THREE of my credit cards trying to hold the flight and told me all three wouldn\\'t go through (this is absurd), we finally cancelled the rebooked flight and she said: \" I guarantee you will be refunded\".\\r\\nIt is now almost two weeks after, no refund, when I call and get the first level of rep, they have no idea what I am talking about and now I am on hold once again for the next level of assistance.  \\r\\nI would absolutely not recommend using Expedia\\'s travel services!

I booked this hotel through expedia around 5:30pm, then due to my personal reason I tried to cancel on 7pm. Since I booked it through expedia, obviously I called expedia to help cancel this order. The service guy accepted my request, and said they may be some charges deductible, I said since it\\'s my reason I have no problem to bear some costs. Then he asked me online to wait for result. After 15-20mintues online waiting, he said the hotel disagreed to refund me, but would continue to charge me full. I said now it\\'s only 7pm, and obviously I would not go to hotel for check in, why should I be charged for full amount? Then he suggested me to contact hotel directly. I said no, because I trust expedia, and I take myself is a customer of expedia, why should I contact any other third party. Finally he said he will try tomorrow and give me updates, then there is no udpates until today. And the full amount charged next day from my credit card.\\n\\nI\\'m ok with this money, cannot hurt me, but I really feel disappointed about expedia. After this matter, I cannot see any value of expedia. Why should I use expedia to book hotels? Expedia should get close cooperation with all partners including this small hotel.

When I called their customer service line, I was eventually (after two minutes of failing to navigate the voice prompts to go straight to a customer service agent) connected to an agent (Alex) in the Philippines who seemed to take an extra-ordinary amount of time (as though it were part of their script) to look up the JetBlue policy on change/cancellation.  It actually took him more than 5 minutes to look this up, which should have been available in seconds.  I prompted him several times during that 5 minutes, and he kept telling me he was still looking it up.  \\n\\nOnce he did, he informed me that they only offered an Expedia credit, that it had to be used within 1 year and that it had to be used with the same airline and for the same person (I purchased the ticked with a credit card for another person).  While I still asked him to cancel the flight, I asked to speak to a supervisor about how the credit after the change fee was issued.  He refused to cancel the flight, and told me that I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes to speak to a supervisor to cancel, and that I had to be on hold all that time to be connected, that he couldn\\'t stay on the line with me, to make sure I didn\\'t get disconnected in the interim.  \\n\\nAt this point, I had already been on the phone with Expedia for almost 20 minutes, and waiting another 20-30 minutes (the usual 1.5x multiplier when customer service agents tell you anticipated hold times for a supervisor) just to cancel a flight I had paid for was frustrating, and I told him he wasn\\'t managing my expectations well.  He eventually did connect me to Ed, his supervisor in the Philippines, who took another 5-10 minutes trying to explain the inflexibility in the cancellation rules, when I kept interrupting him to stop telling me the rules, to please cancel first, and then he can explain the rules.  Finally, at the 32 minute mark, he agreed to do so, but it took him another 2 minutes to do so.  \\n\\nI\\'m a long time Expedia user, I was one of the early adopters of their platform.  I will NEVER use them again.  They need to empower their customer service agents to solve problems, not delay the conversation hoping the customer will go away (happy or not) so they can keep their money.  They also need to empower their supervisors to do the same, instead of dragging out the conversations to make people hang up in frustration.\\n\\nDON\\'T USE EXPEDIA!!!  They will NOT support you, and even though I purchased travel insurance and was changing my flight because of an impending snow storm in the Northeast US, they wasted half an hour of vacation I will never get back, as well as guaranteeing that I will never use them again.

On the other hand if you book a vacation package... well, pray you don\\'t have any problems because the customer service (although professional sounding), doesn\\'t cut it. My letter to Expedia after my trip:   \"The plane developed problems and was diverted to Manaus, Brazil. I contacted Expedia 6 times for a total phone time of 7 hours to resolve the problem... never resolved through Expedia. I had to use another travel site to search alternative flights and then I contacted the original airline to reticket me. Long story short, I lost 20% of my vacation and went through hell to get there. Expedia proved to be worthless for helping me get to my destination. They gave me one suggestion that would have had me stranded in Bogota Columbia for up to 3 more days on standby for a flight to Cancun. Not a viable option for a family vacation! My ground transportation was also cancelled last-minute. No alternative transportation was made and I was left to iron out my own travel details. Bottom line, I lost about 750.00 for lost time at the resort and ground transportation. Instead of looking after my rights, Expedia was begging the airline for what they would be willing to do. When I called the airline I was assertive and gave them flight alternatives to get to my destination in the quickest manner. I was rerouted through MIA and arrived the next morning.\"  Bottom line, although the seem professional, at the end of the day the lipstick has worn off!|I am a Gold status Expedia user and today I booked a trip that included a 7 night stay at a hotel in Berlin. The Expedia agent lied to me about the hotel\\'s cancellation policy, about the location of the hotel (said it was 10 minutes from the conference that I am going to when it is actually one hour away) and about the Expedia consumer rating (he said it was \"Wonderful\" when it is 3 notches below that. I called back to Expedia less than one hour later and waited on the phone through an agent, a supervisor and finally some other higher \"escalation\" to be told, \"there is nothing that we can do for you\". The hotel reservation is for March 2018! Every person I spoke with said, \"don\\'t worry I am going to help you\".

I was charged in full and send a booking confirmation with no errors. Three days later I was charged again, a completely unauthorised use of my credit card details. I was refunded the same day, however I was refunded $100 less than I was charged. I have tired to get in contact with customer support many times but have heard nothing despite their promise to reply within 24 hours. Non-existent customer service for those that can\\'t make international calls to their hotline.

I didn\\'t expect this off such a large and well-established company and now wish I had read reviews before booking. I have read of many similar situations of people getting double charged and NEVER receiving their money back. This company seems to literally steal money from their customers so please DO NOT USE THEM. I have booked through other online providers many times and have never had a problem, but Expedia is an absolute joke even if their prices seem cheap at first.|Dont book unless you are sure enough with your travel dates! they will make an excuse for refunding everything! travel insurance was useless by the way! will cost you a lot and will make you wait for 3-4 months or nothing! customer service was not properly trained. dont fall for their trap!

After my trip, I need the detailed hotel expense breakdown  (room price per day, room tax, etc.) receipt in order to submit my expense report instead of a total hotel change that Expedia sent me via email. I called Expedia several times and requested for a detailed hotel expanse breakdown receipt from them and I got the same answer that they will send it to me within 24 to 48 hours. They never did!!!

At this time, I still did not receive anything from Expedia and I\\'m mad as hell.|For the past few weeks, I have been trying to cancel a booking that I made on Expedia, but nobody from any tier of Expedia has successfully accomplished anything to help me and I am beyond dissatisfied.I booked a hotel via trip advisor, and saw that I was able to get the hotel I wanted through a better price through Expedia.\\r\\nI was confident that the hotel I saw on Expedia was the hotel that I wanted, so I booked a non-refundable rate; however, once I received my receipt, the hotel Expedia booked me for was not the same. I called the first time and spoke to an Expedia agent who was definitely Indian and explained to her my situation. I told her that the hotel on Expedia was not linked up the same, so they needed to do something on their end since it was their fault. She agreed and seemed to totally understand my disappointment.\\r\\nShe called the hotel while we were on the phone to see if she could get it cancelled; however, the hotel was closed at the time she called. She said she would email me the next day after the calling the hotel. The next morning, I received an email; however, the hotel denied my request to cancel. At this point I was started to get a bit agitated considering that I had evidence that this was Expedia\\'s fault.\\r\\nI replied to their emails with screenshots of TripAdvisor showing one hotel, and a screenshot of the incorrect hotel after clicking on the Expedia link from that hotel. After about 2 days, I received an email saying that the hotel denied my request once again. At this point, I was determined to speak to somebody to tell me why they denied this request even though I had evidence that this was their fault. Again, I explained the situation to an Indian woman, and at the end of my story, she says, \"Okay, so you are calling to cancel your reservation?\" I was sure she did not understand English, and to prove I was correct, I asked her, \"Why did I say I was cancelling?\" She would have been able to understand this since I explained this whole issue to her and she had the emails right in front of her.\\r\\nShe replied with, \"Ma\\'am I see that you have a reservation and you are calling to cancel. I can call the hotel if you like to see if they will cancel your reservation.\" At this point, I was done. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and luckily, she understood. I spoke to a man named \"Kevin\" who actually understood the situation.\\r\\nHe said he would pass the issue on to his corporate manager. He gave me a reference number and told me that somebody would contact me within 3 business days. After spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was sure that the issue would be resolved by the next time I talked. I ended up waiting 5 business days with no email or phone call from Expedia updating me with this situation.\\r\\nI called Expedia once again and ended up spending an hour on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. I ended up getting transferred to a woman named Jamila from the corporate Expedia office, and she told me to send a copy of my bank statement showing that I had paid from an email she provided. Before I was able to do this, our call was disconnected. I used the email that Jamila provided and gave her the information that I had.\\r\\nThe hotel collects their payment onsite according to Expedia, so no money has been paid.

I checked in around 10pm on Nov 9, 17 (3 nights). On the morning after, my husband & I went down to lobby to get breakfast around 8:45am, 45 minutes later he came back to the room and found out that the cash envelope was left inside his wallet was gone (all cash /1,140 usd). He reported it to the front office and the manager came in with IT technician to check the door lock, which showed a housekeeper opened the lock at 9:05am and my husband came to open it again at 9:43am. We were asking local Zurich polices to investigate and also do a request fingerprint search + floor hallway camera search but both sides (hotel manager and 3 police officers) denied my request. The hotel manager brought the housekeeper who serviced my room and her supervisor in but of course that lady said \"NO\", even though her face looked very pale. After more than an hour interviewing ours and that lady (separately), everything was gone. And then, late that evening I got a police report like that: \"Die unbekannte Taterschaft entwendet Bargeld aus einer Umhangetasche, wetche im Hotelzimmer auf dem Burotisch abgestellt war. Sie fluchtet unerkannt in unbekannte Richtung.\"\\r\\nI brought this to get translate from all customers in Lobby they all shook their head on this story.

The two internal flights were changed by more then 4 hours each, making it impossible to be on time for  my flight home. Expedia contacted me about the change.  I spent at least an hour on hold/speaking to a rep about the issue.  He was able to rebook the internal flights and told me the original flights would be refunded.  Then, I find the rebooked flights were cancelled due to my \"credit card not going through\", I called and again spent an incredible amount of time on hold and then spoke to a totally incompetent rep who finally got me to a supervisor.  The supervisor took THREE of my credit cards trying to hold the flight and told me all three wouldn\\'t go through (this is absurd), we finally cancelled the rebooked flight and she said: \" I guarantee you will be refunded\".\\r\\nIt is now almost two weeks after, no refund, when I call and get the first level of rep, they have no idea what I am talking about and now I am on hold once again for the next level of assistance.  \\r\\nI would absolutely not recommend using Expedia\\'s travel services!

I booked this hotel through expedia around 5:30pm, then due to my personal reason I tried to cancel on 7pm. Since I booked it through expedia, obviously I called expedia to help cancel this order. The service guy accepted my request, and said they may be some charges deductible, I said since it's my reason I have no problem to bear some costs. Then he asked me online to wait for result. After 15-20mintues online waiting, he said the hotel disagreed to refund me, but would continue to charge me full. I said now it's only 7pm, and obviously I would not go to hotel for check in, why should I be charged for full amount? Then he suggested me to contact hotel directly. I said no, because I trust expedia, and I take myself is a customer of expedia, why should I contact any other third party. Finally he said he will try tomorrow and give me updates, then there is no udpates until today. And the full amount charged next day from my credit card.\\n\\nI'm ok with this money, cannot hurt me, but I really feel disappointed about expedia. After this matter, I cannot see any value of expedia. Why should I use expedia to book hotels? Expedia should get close cooperation with all partners including this small hotel.

When I called their customer service line, I was eventually (after two minutes of failing to navigate the voice prompts to go straight to a customer service agent) connected to an agent (Alex) in the Philippines who seemed to take an extra-ordinary amount of time (as though it were part of their script) to look up the JetBlue policy on change/cancellation.  It actually took him more than 5 minutes to look this up, which should have been available in seconds.  I prompted him several times during that 5 minutes, and he kept telling me he was still looking it up.  \\n\\nOnce he did, he informed me that they only offered an Expedia credit, that it had to be used within 1 year and that it had to be used with the same airline and for the same person (I purchased the ticked with a credit card for another person).  While I still asked him to cancel the flight, I asked to speak to a supervisor about how the credit after the change fee was issued.  He refused to cancel the flight, and told me that I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes to speak to a supervisor to cancel, and that I had to be on hold all that time to be connected, that he couldn't stay on the line with me, to make sure I didn't get disconnected in the interim.  \\n\\nAt this point, I had already been on the phone with Expedia for almost 20 minutes, and waiting another 20-30 minutes (the usual 1.5x multiplier when customer service agents tell you anticipated hold times for a supervisor) just to cancel a flight I had paid for was frustrating, and I told him he wasn't managing my expectations well.  He eventually did connect me to Ed, his supervisor in the Philippines, who took another 5-10 minutes trying to explain the inflexibility in the cancellation rules, when I kept interrupting him to stop telling me the rules, to please cancel first, and then he can explain the rules.  Finally, at the 32 minute mark, he agreed to do so, but it took him another 2 minutes to do so.  \\n\\nI'm a long time Expedia user, I was one of the early adopters of their platform.  I will NEVER use them again.  They need to empower their customer service agents to solve problems, not delay the conversation hoping the customer will go away (happy or not) so they can keep their money.  They also need to empower their supervisors to do the same, instead of dragging out the conversations to make people hang up in frustration.\\n\\nDON'T USE EXPEDIA!!!  They will NOT support you, and even though I purchased travel insurance and was changing my flight because of an impending snow storm in the Northeast US, they wasted half an hour of vacation I will never get back, as well as guaranteeing that I will never use them again.

I contacted Expedia 6 times for a total phone time of 7 hours to resolve the problem... never resolved through Expedia. I had to use another travel site to search alternative flights and then I contacted the original airline to reticket me. Long story short, I lost 20% of my vacation and went through hell to get there. Expedia proved to be worthless for helping me get to my destination. They gave me one suggestion that would have had me stranded in Bogota Columbia for up to 3 more days on standby for a flight to Cancun. Not a viable option for a family vacation! My ground transportation was also cancelled last-minute. No alternative transportation was made and I was left to iron out my own travel details. Bottom line, I lost about 750.00 for lost time at the resort and ground transportation. Instead of looking after my rights, Expedia was begging the airline for what they would be willing to do. When I called the airline I was assertive and gave them flight alternatives to get to my destination in the quickest manner.

I called back to Expedia less than one hour later and waited on the phone through an agent, a supervisor and finally some other higher \"escalation\" to be told, \"there is nothing that we can do for you\". The hotel reservation is for March 2018! Every person I spoke with said, \"don\\'t worry I am going to help you\". Beware of this company, their Gold status is garbage and they only care about getting your money. Once they have it they could care less about the customer.', \"I booked a flight with Expedia recently, and at first everything seemed fine. I was charged in full and send a booking confirmation with no errors. Three days later I was charged again, a completely unauthorised use of my credit card details. I was refunded the same day, however I was refunded $100 less than I was charged. I have tired to get in contact with customer support many times but have heard nothing despite their promise to reply within 24 hours. Non-existent customer service for those that can't make international calls to their hotline. It has been over a week now and I am quickly running out of hope that I will ever receive a reply to my many emails. I am now extremely concerned that this company has my credit card details and seems fine make charges to my card without my permission. I didn't expect this off such a large and well-established company and now wish I had read reviews before booking. I have read of many similar situations of people getting double charged and NEVER receiving their money back. This company seems to literally steal money from their customers so please DO NOT USE THEM. I have booked through other online providers many times and have never had a problem, but Expedia is an absolute joke even if their prices seem cheap at first.\", 'Dont book unless you are sure enough with your travel dates! they will make an excuse for refunding everything! travel insurance was useless by the way! will cost you a lot and will make you wait for 3-4 months or nothing! customer service was not properly trained. dont fall for their trap! I am warning you!', \"Do not fall for spending the extra $35 to protect your flight in case you have to change or cancel. \\n\\nThey will give you every excuse not to give you back your money. Literally had to hound them for 2 months just to get a partial refund (countless emails, hour upon hours of phone conversations with customer support, and even using the prehistoric fax machine). \\n\\nI would highly recommend avoiding booking flights with expedia in general but if you have to you better be 99.9% sure you won't have to cancel or change flight because their protection plan is absolutely worthless.\", \"Attending a conference in Austin so I book my hotel and airline ticket through Expedia.

I called Expedia several times and requested for a detailed hotel expanse breakdown receipt from them and I got the same answer that they will send it to me within 24 to 48 hours. They never did!!!  I called again and again, and finally got in touch with their support supervisor and she sent me the 'itinerary' instead, TWICE. At this time, I still did not receive anything from Expedia and I'm mad as hell.\", 'For the past few weeks, I have been trying to cancel a booking that I made on Expedia, but nobody from any tier of Expedia has successfully accomplished anything to help me and I am beyond dissatisfied.I booked a hotel via trip advisor, and saw that I was able to get the hotel I wanted through a better price through Expedia.\\r\\nI was confident that the hotel I saw on Expedia was the hotel that I wanted, so I booked a non-refundable rate; however, once I received my receipt, the hotel Expedia booked me for was not the same. I called the first time and spoke to an Expedia agent who was definitely Indian and explained to her my situation. I told her that the hotel on Expedia was not linked up the same, so they needed to do something on their end since it was their fault. She agreed and seemed to totally understand my disappointment.\\r\\nShe called the hotel while we were on the phone to see if she could get it cancelled; however, the hotel was closed at the time she called. She said she would email me the next day after the calling the hotel. The next morning, I received an email; however, the hotel denied my request to cancel. At this point I was started to get a bit agitated considering that I had evidence that this was Expedia\\'s fault.\\r\\nI replied to their emails with screenshots of TripAdvisor showing one hotel, and a screenshot of the incorrect hotel after clicking on the Expedia link from that hotel. After about 2 days, I received an email saying that the hotel denied my request once again. At this point, I was determined to speak to somebody to tell me why they denied this request even though I had evidence that this was their fault. Again, I explained the situation to an Indian woman, and at the end of my story, she says, \"Okay, so you are calling to cancel your reservation?\" I was sure she did not understand English, and to prove I was correct, I asked her, \"Why did I say I was cancelling?\" She would have been able to understand this since I explained this whole issue to her and she had the emails right in front of her.\\r\\nShe replied with, \"Ma\\'am I see that you have a reservation and you are calling to cancel. I can call the hotel if you like to see if they will cancel your reservation.\" At this point, I was done. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and luckily, she understood. I spoke to a man named \"Kevin\" who actually understood the situation.\\r\\nHe said he would pass the issue on to his corporate manager. He gave me a reference number and told me that somebody would contact me within 3 business days. After spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was sure that the issue would be resolved by the next time I talked. I ended up waiting 5 business days with no email or phone call from Expedia updating me with this situation.\\r\\nI called Expedia once again and ended up spending an hour on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. I ended up getting transferred to a woman named Jamila from the corporate Expedia office, and she told me to send a copy of my bank statement showing that I had paid from an email she provided. Before I was able to do this, our call was disconnected. I used the email that Jamila provided and gave her the information that I had.\\r\\nThe hotel collects their payment onsite according to Expedia, so no money has been paid. All I want is to cancel the reservation. I have a lot of evidence showing that this is Expedia\\'s mistake. Nobody has ever contacted me and I want this issue to be resolved.\\r\\nBecause of Expedia\\'s mistake, I am stuck with a hotel I don\\'t want, and I have spent countless hours trying to resolve this issue with little success. Today, I tried contacting Expedia through Facebook again with all of my evidence, but nothing can be done. They accepted that it may have been a site error, but they refuse to cancel my reservation. Absolutely F- customer service.\\r\\nThis has been a huge waste of time and energy.\\r\\nI will NEVER buy anything from Expedia again.I have truly thought about suing the company, but it\\'s not worth the $300 they stole from me.', 'I had a very bad experience in this 5 star hotel and am going to share it with everyone.

Do I have that correct?\\r\\n Wendy F.: I understand that the amount after the refund may be different from the price you saw advertised on our site.

I paid for a year and, after 1 month, I get a message saying my account has been terminated. I had no idea why, and asked them. They referred me to their \"Terms of Use\", which is voluminous and complicated. I read it anyway and didn\\'t see anything I did to violate any of their terms. I asked them to clarify and they refused to tell me why they terminated my account. \\n\\nIn the meantime, I had spent hundreds of hours cultivating relationships on the site, only to have all of those conversations become inaccessible to me as I can\\'t log on to the site. \\n\\nAND, they have my money and refuse to refund it.\\n\\nI would not recommend anybody using this site, as you could be wasting a LOT of time and money, should they arbitrarily decide to pull the rug out from under you for no reason.|Match.com engages in discriminatory business practices, based on gender. Male (and almost exclusively only male) customers are often reported by other users or my match.com employees for \"verbally harassing\" other members, even when they do not communicate with other members at all. While other members\\' reporting may be simply a trolling or revenge practice (resulting from a lack of interest received from male members), match.com employee reporting is a practice directly supported by the company itself. One of the most active corporate-sponsored scammers works under the name \"Tony E.\".\\n\\nFollowing the completely fake, unfounded accusation(s), the merchant terminates the unsuspecting users\\' account, without looking into the facts or giving any explanation, falsely citing the male user\\'s supposed behavior, while providing no evidence whatsoever, of it. The merchant hides behind its reference to \"privacy policy\" and typically gets away with wrongfully terminating the account with zero explanation or proof of alleged activity given.\\n\\nThe merchant then collects the funds for partial or no service rendered, as the terminated member does not get reimbursed for the remainder of the the original, pre-paid subscription term, often at a value in excess of hundreds of dollars. The customer service center refuses to answer inquiries from the wrongfully terminated member, hangs up on the caller, states that it has no relationship with the corporate office itself, which supposedly decides over investigation or cancellations. The only step it recommends is to email the corporate office - but the corporate office refuses to respond to emails altogether.\\n\\nCuriously, though, this scamming practice includes the invitation of user to open up another, brand new account, effectively paying again for the already-purchased service.(!)  Very well organized scam with a well-established brand to cover it. \\n\\nThe above findings have been thoroughly documented, and the documentation is now being used in support of a lawsuit by the legal representation of three members, one of which is the author of the above review.|match.com sent me on dates with serial-dating women that were only interested in a free meal... furthermore... they sent me on a date with a catholic school teacher that was only interested in my finances and worth...

Suzie x|I recently signed up for match.com as user name MYSTAGIC, and got a few people that contacted me, but I couldn\\'t view or click on any of this stuff or even know who was viewing me, until I pay for service, so I paid for service to see who was messaging me, so I wrote some responses to a few people and started talking to someone and we were really hitting it off, but I had to sleep it was 3 am, so I logged out and the next day my account was terminated and no indication to why, and I know I didn\\'t write anything offensive or bad, I uploaded a single photo, and barely used the site, I didn\\'t even have service for more then 12 hours so I wasn\\'t even able to setup anything or proceed with talking to the person I was talking with and now that I am no longer on the site I have no way to contact them. Using match.com was one of the most awful experiences I have ever had with any online site. They give no warning or even explain why your service was terminated, when you try to talk to them they simply refuse to give any real information, and after doing so research into this company they have had serious issues dating as far back as 2011. \\n\\nI paid for service on: 10 December 2017 at 00:11 am\\r\\naccount was terminated at : 10 December 2017 at 06:14 am\\n\\nI only used the site for roughly 3 hours and got permanently terminated, for some unknown reason that they won\\'t even tell me.

They robbed my chance of talking to someone that I found very interesting, though it\\'s very possible that the activity sent to my account was entirely fake and generated by match.com to be fooled into buying service. Seeing how, not even moments after signing up I receive allegedly all this winks, profile likes, and private messages, from real users, which I find it hard to believe I got all that activity within my first 10 minutes of using the site with a incomplete profile. Then after buying services I could respond to these items. But then suddenly without warning my account is terminated, and I have to get a refund, thankfully, I paid through paypal and have buyer protection. If your looking for dating sites, I wouldn\\'t put match.com any where near my choices, and I will never recommend this site to anyone, and anyone asking about this site, I will tell them the very short experience I had with it.|if your subscription is renewed automatically, even if you call them on the day it happened, they will not issue you a refund, not even a partial refund. This happened to me and a girl i was dating. So you are charged a full price for 6 months. The customer service reps are extremely rude, and would simply hand up the phone after stating that they do not have such a thing as a \"refund\". Honestly, this is the first time i experience such a horrible customer service from an online service. I have had excellent experiences at ebay, amazon, newegg, okcupid, etc. Please stay away from them.|After at least two years of off-and-on subscriptions, I had had enough and thought I had cancelled automatic renewals, which they say are \"for your convenience.\"  About 3 or 4 days after my subscription should have lapsed, I realized that my subscription seemed to be still in effect, although they had not notified me of billing me for a new subscription period.  I tried to contact customer service, but it was Friday after 4 p.m. PST, and their offices are only open during business hours CST, M-F!  After difficulty even finding a phone number, I called them on Monday, and was told me that a refund was \"blocked\" because I had sent ONE message (to be sure my subscription was still in effect).  They refused to refund the UNUSED PORTION of my subscription (two months and three weeks) for the same silly reason, as if computers are unable to calculate the portion remaining.  It\\'s another dating SCAM.|I stopped using the website but then I found a $71 USD charge on my credit card. match.com automatically charged me a 3 month renewal fee of $71 USD two days earlier. I received no email notice from them leading up to the automatic payment. I called their number and the operator said the best he can do is refund me $20.01 and he refused to transfer me to his supervisor. In summary they charged me $51 for a service I did not use.|My account got hacked!  Some lady put two photos on my profile, messaged a whole lot of people, \\'liked\\' people I wouldn\\'t of \\'liked\\', and then blocked a whole bunch. Not a very secure site apparently. I called Match to try to get a refund and they flat refused.   Be very cautious.|Over 100 emails sent out and not a single responce. Most profiles are fishing scams. Canceled my subscription and deactivated my account a MONTH ago yet they still just hit my bank for another $104 and refuse to refund my money since i did not save my confirmation number. When called they say my account is still active and visable and even though they charged me less then 24 hours ago im stuck having a paid membership for another 3 months.

Still when I count up what ive spend and the number of good dates ive been on it doesnt make for great reading put it that way.

If you are a minority, short of stature and poor, you will be more poor when you pay for a membership.  No real women ever answered my messages.|All these dating sites show you all these men that are supposed to be in your area. When you join and they get your money there is no good looking men or women in your area they are hundreds of miles away. So many people are  dissatisfied with these dating sites as they are truly looking for true love and come up empty handed after paying all that money out. But lets face we all rely on these sites as where else is there to go to meet men and women that you are looking for to spend the rest of your life with surly not a bar. So match is not the only one they are all  guilty  of it zoosk, plenty of fish, our time, Udate, MeetMindful,  senior dating and dating 50 and over. And many more I am sure. This is wrong to get peoples hopes up and take their money when all they want to do is find love. They should all have to give you a 7 day trail to look at the site for free to see if what they are saying is true. And if it is then charge the person but to take money and all the people they show you are hundreds of miles away your not going to find love that way lets be  realistic .|Everyone is complaining about you for your systems.

Even if it doesn\\'t end up my long term choice, it proves that theres no point in being loyal to match forever and thinking that nothing is better just because they spend lots on advertising.

Your bank can provide you more details about when it will appear on your statement, when the funds will be available to you, etc.\\n\\nIf you paid to attend an upcoming Match Event, please know your name has been removed from the RSVP list and any charges associated with the event have been refunded.\\n\\nFor reference, our Terms of Use can be accessed at the following link: http://www.match.com/registration/membagr.aspx.\\n\\r\\nRegards,\\n\\nMatch Corporate Care\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOverall, I do not recommend this site for any reason whatsoever. They robbed my chance of talking to someone that I found very interesting, though it's very possible that the activity sent to my account was entirely fake and generated by match.com to be fooled into buying service. Seeing how, not even moments after signing up I receive allegedly all this winks, profile likes, and private messages, from real users, which I find it hard to believe I got all that activity within my first 10 minutes of using the site with a incomplete profile. Then after buying services I could respond to these items. But then suddenly without warning my account is terminated, and I have to get a refund, thankfully, I paid through paypal and have buyer protection. If your looking for dating sites, I wouldn't put match.com any where near my choices, and I will never recommend this site to anyone, and anyone asking about this site, I will tell them the very short experience I had with it.\", 'if your subscription is renewed automatically, even if you call them on the day it happened, they will not issue you a refund, not even a partial refund. This happened to me and a girl i was dating. So you are charged a full price for 6 months. The customer service reps are extremely rude, and would simply hand up the phone after stating that they do not have such a thing as a \"refund\". Honestly, this is the first time i experience such a horrible customer service from an online service. I have had excellent experiences at ebay, amazon, newegg, okcupid, etc. Please stay away from them.', 'After at least two years of off-and-on subscriptions, I had had enough and thought I had cancelled automatic renewals, which they say are \"for your convenience.\"  About 3 or 4 days after my subscription should have lapsed, I realized that my subscription seemed to be still in effect, although they had not notified me of billing me for a new subscription period.  I tried to contact customer service, but it was Friday after 4 p.m. PST, and their offices are only open during business hours CST, M-F!  After difficulty even finding a phone number, I called them on Monday, and was told me that a refund was \"blocked\" because I had sent ONE message (to be sure my subscription was still in effect).  They refused to refund the UNUSED PORTION of my subscription (two months and three weeks) for the same silly reason, as if computers are unable to calculate the portion remaining.  It\\'s another dating SCAM.', 'I stopped using the website but then I found a $71 USD charge on my credit card. match.com automatically charged me a 3 month renewal fee of $71 USD two days earlier. I received no email notice from them leading up to the automatic payment. I called their number and the operator said the best he can do is refund me $20.01 and he refused to transfer me to his supervisor. In summary they charged me $51 for a service I did not use.', \"My account got hacked!  Some lady put two photos on my profile, messaged a whole lot of people, 'liked' people I wouldn't of 'liked', and then blocked a whole bunch. Not a very secure site apparently. I called Match to try to get a refund and they flat refused.   Be very cautious.\", 'Over 100 emails sent out and not a single responce. Most profiles are fishing scams. Canceled my subscription and deactivated my account a MONTH ago yet they still just hit my bank for another $104 and refuse to refund my money since i did not save my confirmation number. When called they say my account is still active and visable and even though they charged me less then 24 hours ago im stuck having a paid membership for another 3 months. AVOID this site at all costs!', 'Just when you think youve had enough you finally get a date. Thats my experience on match. I keep saying im going to quit and try one of the more fashionable new sites (wejustfit gets a lot of good reviews for example) but then I get another date and im all giddy again for a week. Still when I count up what ive spend and the number of good dates ive been on it doesnt make for great reading put it that way. To summarise: worth a try but dont limit yourself  theres more to online dating than match (even if I dont take my own advice lol)!', 'A waste of money.  If you are a minority, short of stature and poor, you will be more poor when you pay for a membership.  No real women ever answered my messages.', 'All these dating sites show you all these men that are supposed to be in your area. When you join and they get your money there is no good looking men or women in your area they are hundreds of miles away. So many people are  dissatisfied with these dating sites as they are truly looking for true love and come up empty handed after paying all that money out. But lets face we all rely on these sites as where else is there to go to meet men and women that you are looking for to spend the rest of your life with surly not a bar. So match is not the only one they are all  guilty  of it zoosk, plenty of fish, our time, Udate, MeetMindful,  senior dating and dating 50 and over. And many more I am sure. This is wrong to get peoples hopes up and take their money when all they want to do is find love. They should all have to give you a 7 day trail to look at the site for free to see if what they are saying is true. And if it is then charge the person but to take money and all the people they show you are hundreds of miles away your not going to find love that way lets be  realistic .', \"Everyone is complaining about you for your systems. I signed up for Match.com with their 6 month guarantee. After 6 months they kept charging my credit card. and you didn't send an email to inform that you get money from my account.\", \"I used to use this site down south and it was much better. I dont know if its not as effective for me for setting up dates because its generally worse overall or because I moved to Glasgow. I've started using wejustfit after I read an article about a couple that met on that site and its a case of so far, so good. Even if it doesn't end up my long term choice, it proves that theres no point in being loyal to match forever and thinking that nothing is better just because they spend lots on advertising. It always pays to stay on the ball. You wouldnt keep paying for your broadband service if it wasn't working for weeks at a time now would you?\", 'The matct.com customer support is terrible. After two emails, they sent the letter that they are not going respond to the request anymore. The problem was not solved. Also, the website has a huge amount of bugs, can be hacked easily. Very disappointed with match.com service.', 'My husband is Danceguitar, Texas irwing. 41\\r\\nDo not trust this man. I married him in November 1st 2013\\r\\nAll docs available\\r\\nI am his third wife', 'I signed up for Match.com with their  6 month guarantee. After 6 months they kept charging my credit card. After calling them multiple times, they told me that I should have gone under my account settings & adjusted their default settings within a certain timeframe even though my status stated Guarantee. JUST CALL YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANY TO REMOVE THE CHARGES,  THEN TRY THE BUMBLE DATING SITE BECAUSE IT IS JUST AS GOOD IN MY OPINION, & IT IS FREE.']\n"

There is nothing they can do for you if it states that it has been picked up other than contact your credit card company for fraud.|A big problem with buying on Walmart.com is that they don\\'t offer Buyer Protection.

The seller won\\'t return my emails and hung up on me each time I tried to call their 800 number.

I think i am even more upset that Walmart, as well as in my own research, had a contact phone number which was non-working. I even tried to research the company  ( in NC) and they don\\'t even exist!   I blame WALMART for deceiving their customers, that they are first involved with with their  third party retailers, and NOT their own stores, who are not researched nor reputable, Buyers Beware! don\\'t deal with Walmart on-line..they can\\'t come close to the efficiency of Amazon..|Walmart is obviously known for giving us a good value and ordering online is so convenient but it is dissapointing to always find my purchased items packaged so poorly.

Good quality merchandise and good prices = happy..|i love walmart and to be able to use walmart.com to order things is great since i have no way really to get there...they offer free shipping or free pickup of most orders and they come in really fast. i recommend it to everyone|December 26th, 20187\\r\\nTo Whom it May Concern:\\r\\nFor Christmas, my 3 year old daughter, Ella  and 3 year old god daughter, Maddie asked Santa for balance bikes. Every time they saw Santa (and anyone else who would ask) they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for. They have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift.\\r\\n I went to Walmart to purchase one and it was not available in the store, but a helpful assistant informed me I could order it online for store pickup before Christmas. I thought this was awesome and right there in the store I ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of Friday, December 22nd. Just in time for Christmas! I was so happy I had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes. \\r\\nOn Friday, December 22nd I went to the pickup counter of my local Walmart to get their Christmas presents. And the bikes were not there. I was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until Tuesday, December 26th the day after Christmas. \\r\\nThis was of course a huge let down. I stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated DELIVERY BY FRIDAY DECEMBER 22nd in big bold font. and could not process what he was telling me. What would I do for Christmas?! Right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop. How could I explain to my girls that Santa was not going to bring them what they wanted? What was I going to do? The man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma Walmart put me in and informed me there was nothing I could do but call 1800Walmart. He did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me. \\r\\nI immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store. The first women I talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly. I asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy I was transferred to was a complete $#*!. He had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as I sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save Christmas for my children. \\r\\nFinally, he was able to transfer me to someone in another department. This women was the first person I spoke to who was empathetic. She patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as I frantically tried to picture how I would explain to my daughters that Santa was not able to deliver their gifts. I asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on Tuesday. She gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience I was experiencing. \\r\\n As I sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a Walmart employee named Bradley working at the pickup counter. He was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone.  Unlike the first man I encountered at the store, Bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could. He even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other Walmart in the phoenix metro area. I was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone. Unfortunately, Walmart and every other major store did not carry this item in stores. \\r\\nBradley sat there with me and listened as I cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how I felt like such a failure because I was letting my girls down. He came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets, kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming.\\r\\nChristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents, including the helmets, kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for. I explained to them that Santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on Tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at Walmart where Santa had them waiting just for us. \\r\\nI received an email from Walmart.com Tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at Walmart. I packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see Santas special delivery with plans to pick up Maddie afterward and test out the new bikes.\\r\\nWhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there. I told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one. He went in the back to get a manager as I pulled up the email clearly stating Quantity: 2. My old friend Bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came. Disappointed, and trying to figure out how I was going to explain to Maddie that Santa only had one bike not two at the store  I left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to Walmart to pick up this impossibly challenging Christmas present. \\r\\nLater that day I got a voicemail from Bradley as I was putting my kids down for their naps. He let me know that the bike had arrived, but that I was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded. \\r\\nHe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the Walmart.com phone number for me, explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone. The people he spoke to on the phone told him I had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what I was told when I called customer service on 12/22. \\r\\nLuckily, my children were napping, because once again the tears came pouring down my face as I tried to understand what was going on. I called 1800Walmart and was transferred three times until I began to speak with Kiki. Who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution. \\r\\nShe informed me that while the third person I spoke to on 12/22  Allison  may have told me I would get a refund and the bikes  - that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes. As Allison was not working today, she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now. I am aware that calls are recorded  so I was very frustrated that this phone call from 12/22 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me. She let me know the only way I would be getting the bike was if I went in and re-purchased them. Which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point.\\r\\nCurrently -  the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the Walmart pickup counter.  It seems Santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents, which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when Santa promised them two. \\r\\nAt this point - Walmart has robbed me of hours of my life. I have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 12/22 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today. I have traveled to Walmart to try to get the bikes three separate times (with a 1 and 3 year old  that is SO easy).  I have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways I can still make this gift magical for my girls.\\r\\nThe irony of this situation is that I choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a Walmart employee. Instead, this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life. The additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin. \\r\\nI have come up with a solution to try to save Christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls. \\r\\nNot only do I want you to release the bike promised to me on 12/22 for pick up, I also think Ella and Maddie deserve bells and bike tassels on their new bikes for their patience. If you could figure out a way to have Santa deliver it even better. \\r\\nSincerely, \\r\\nAndrea Hogan|Well, I was at Walmart again a few days before Xmas.  You would think, especially at this time of year, that you would be able to go into Walmart and not spend the majority of your time in the store standing in line with countless others waiting to checkout.  The day we we were there WM only had 6 checkout stands open.  One was at the cigaret counter with a counter so small you could only get 3 or 4 items on it at a time.  All 6 of the check stands had eight or more people in line with baskets filled to the top.  Some had two baskets.  \\r\\n     At the same time there were multiples of WM people walking around with their personal cell phones held up to their ears.  They walked right past us and I had to move so some of them could pass.  We could not us the quick check because we had some alcoholic beverages for our Xmas guests in our basket.  \\r\\n     Finally, a manager walked by and I mentioned we had been standing in line for close to 30 minutes and I was getting upset about the wait.  I told her it had taken us 3 times less time to shop than we had already waited to check out.  She grudgingly went to the nearest check stand and opened it taking the person behind us.  Ten minutes later we got checked out.\\r\\n     As we walked through the store to leave I noticed there were at least 12 or more people standing in each checkout line of which there were again only six open.  I didn\\'t think things could get worse at this store.  But, boy oh boy, I was wrong!|I ordered Risk board game, tracking says it arrived on 12/22, its 12/25 Xmas and my daughters are now very sad they didnt get the game on time.

The seller won't return my emails and hung up on me each time I tried to call their 800 number.

Every time they saw Santa (and anyone else who would ask) they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for. They have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift.\\r\\n I went to Walmart to purchase one and it was not available in the store, but a helpful assistant informed me I could order it online for store pickup before Christmas. I thought this was awesome and right there in the store I ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of Friday, December 22nd. Just in time for Christmas! I was so happy I had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes. \\r\\nOn Friday, December 22nd I went to the pickup counter of my local Walmart to get their Christmas presents. And the bikes were not there. I was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until Tuesday, December 26th the day after Christmas. \\r\\nThis was of course a huge let down. I stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated DELIVERY BY FRIDAY DECEMBER 22nd in big bold font. and could not process what he was telling me. What would I do for Christmas?! Right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop. How could I explain to my girls that Santa was not going to bring them what they wanted? What was I going to do? The man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma Walmart put me in and informed me there was nothing I could do but call 1800Walmart. He did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me. \\r\\nI immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store. The first women I talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly. I asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy I was transferred to was a complete $#*!. He had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as I sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save Christmas for my children. \\r\\nFinally, he was able to transfer me to someone in another department. This women was the first person I spoke to who was empathetic. She patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as I frantically tried to picture how I would explain to my daughters that Santa was not able to deliver their gifts. I asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on Tuesday. She gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience I was experiencing. \\r\\n As I sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a Walmart employee named Bradley working at the pickup counter. He was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone.  Unlike the first man I encountered at the store, Bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could. He even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other Walmart in the phoenix metro area. I was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone. Unfortunately, Walmart and every other major store did not carry this item in stores. \\r\\nBradley sat there with me and listened as I cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how I felt like such a failure because I was letting my girls down. He came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets, kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming.\\r\\nChristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents, including the helmets, kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for. I explained to them that Santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on Tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at Walmart where Santa had them waiting just for us. \\r\\nI received an email from Walmart.com Tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at Walmart. I packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see Santas special delivery with plans to pick up Maddie afterward and test out the new bikes.\\r\\nWhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there. I told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one. He went in the back to get a manager as I pulled up the email clearly stating Quantity: 2. My old friend Bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came. Disappointed, and trying to figure out how I was going to explain to Maddie that Santa only had one bike not two at the store  I left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to Walmart to pick up this impossibly challenging Christmas present. \\r\\nLater that day I got a voicemail from Bradley as I was putting my kids down for their naps. He let me know that the bike had arrived, but that I was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded. \\r\\nHe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the Walmart.com phone number for me, explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone. The people he spoke to on the phone told him I had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what I was told when I called customer service on 12/22. \\r\\nLuckily, my children were napping, because once again the tears came pouring down my face as I tried to understand what was going on. I called 1800Walmart and was transferred three times until I began to speak with Kiki. Who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution. \\r\\nShe informed me that while the third person I spoke to on 12/22  Allison  may have told me I would get a refund and the bikes  - that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes. As Allison was not working today, she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now. I am aware that calls are recorded  so I was very frustrated that this phone call from 12/22 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me. She let me know the only way I would be getting the bike was if I went in and re-purchased them. Which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point.\\r\\nCurrently -  the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the Walmart pickup counter.  It seems Santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents, which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when Santa promised them two. \\r\\nAt this point - Walmart has robbed me of hours of my life. I have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 12/22 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today. I have traveled to Walmart to try to get the bikes three separate times (with a 1 and 3 year old  that is SO easy).  I have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways I can still make this gift magical for my girls.\\r\\nThe irony of this situation is that I choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a Walmart employee. Instead, this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life. The additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin. \\r\\nI have come up with a solution to try to save Christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls. \\r\\nNot only do I want you to release the bike promised to me on 12/22 for pick up, I also think Ella and Maddie deserve bells and bike tassels on their new bikes for their patience. If you could figure out a way to have Santa deliver it even better. \\r\\nSincerely, \\r\\nAndrea Hogan', \"Well, I was at Walmart again a few days before Xmas.  You would think, especially at this time of year, that you would be able to go into Walmart and not spend the majority of your time in the store standing in line with countless others waiting to checkout.  The day we we were there WM only had 6 checkout stands open.  One was at the cigaret counter with a counter so small you could only get 3 or 4 items on it at a time.  All 6 of the check stands had eight or more people in line with baskets filled to the top.  Some had two baskets.  \\r\\n     At the same time there were multiples of WM people walking around with their personal cell phones held up to their ears.  They walked right past us and I had to move so some of them could pass.  We could not us the quick check because we had some alcoholic beverages for our Xmas guests in our basket.  \\r\\n     Finally, a manager walked by and I mentioned we had been standing in line for close to 30 minutes and I was getting upset about the wait.  I told her it had taken us 3 times less time to shop than we had already waited to check out.  She grudgingly went to the nearest check stand and opened it taking the person behind us.  Ten minutes later we got checked out.\\r\\n     As we walked through the store to leave I noticed there were at least 12 or more people standing in each checkout line of which there were again only six open.  I didn't think things could get worse at this store.  But, boy oh boy, I was wrong!\", 'I ordered Risk board game, tracking says it arrived on 12/22, its 12/25 Xmas and my daughters are now very sad they didnt get the game on time.

I have been a frequent traveller for years, up until the last few months I thought  was a good idea. Here are issues that I believe are scams, terrible customer service, and unacceptable:1. Wait time to receive any assistance. In total I have spent upwards of 9 hours on hold waiting for assistance in the span of two weeks, after the Airline kept changing my flights and I had to call to reselect a better flight. I had to ask to be transferred to a different agent a couple of times when they don\\'t understand what is going on (when the flight is changed you have the option to re-select a better flight due to the change at no charge. Some agents don\\'t even know that and try to charge you).2. Advertise false information. a) I rented a car, and when I got to the airport I found out the location I selected wasn\\'t in the airport (My fault for not paying attention even though when booking I clicked that I wanted airport location). I went on  and it said I could cancel with no cost. So I did. THEN I get home and I still got charged and  says \"well we don\\'t charge you a cancellation, but the car rental company does\". That\\'s unbelievable. I booked through them, and they say they just relay information to the consumer as they are not the actual car company. Yet they clearly relay wrong information!b) Cancellation insurance. NEVER buy this scam. They are quite clever in the way they advertise this. When you book it says Cancellation insurance, refund for any change or cancellation fees. My friend couldn\\'t get a passport for her trip and I figured it wasn\\'t a big deal since I bought the cancellation insurance, except this insurance is worth jack sh-t, which is apparently in the fine print that they hide on there. Only for medical emergencies does it apply really. 3) Poor customer service. I needed to change a flight due to the unwilling flight change the airline provided. The  agents all told me there\\'s nothing I can do and I cant change or get any money back. I called the airline directly and they had amazing customer service, made the change no problems.  agents were clearly too lazy to even bother calling the airline for me.4) They will claim they have no responsibility or ability to do anything for your bookings since they just \"advertise\" for 3rd party companies. LESSON, always book directly through the service you want to receive.\\r\\n            ', 'In September we flew china southern airlines to Oslo .

When I called their customer service line, I was eventually (after two minutes of failing to navigate the voice prompts to go straight to a customer service agent) connected to an agent (Alex) in the Philippines who seemed to take an extra-ordinary amount of time (as though it were part of their script) to look up the JetBlue policy on change/cancellation.  It actually took him more than 5 minutes to look this up, which should have been available in seconds.  I prompted him several times during that 5 minutes, and he kept telling me he was still looking it up.  Once he did, he informed me that they only offered an  credit, that it had to be used within 1 year and that it had to be used with the same airline and for the same person (I purchased the ticked with a credit card for another person).  While I still asked him to cancel the flight, I asked to speak to a supervisor about how the credit after the change fee was issued.  He refused to cancel the flight, and told me that I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes to speak to a supervisor to cancel, and that I had to be on hold all that time to be connected, that he couldn't stay on the line with me, to make sure I didn't get disconnected in the interim.  At this point, I had already been on the phone with  for almost 20 minutes, and waiting another 20-30 minutes (the usual 1.5x multiplier when customer service agents tell you anticipated hold times for a supervisor) just to cancel a flight I had paid for was frustrating, and I told him he wasn't managing my expectations well.  He eventually did connect me to Ed, his supervisor in the Philippines, who took another 5-10 minutes trying to explain the inflexibility in the cancellation rules, when I kept interrupting him to stop telling me the rules, to please cancel first, and then he can explain the rules.  Finally, at the 32 minute mark, he agreed to do so, but it took him another 2 minutes to do so.  I'm a long time  user, I was one of the early adopters of their platform.  I will NEVER use them again.  They need to empower their customer service agents to solve problems, not delay the conversation hoping the customer will go away (happy or not) so they can keep their money.  They also need to empower their supervisors to do the same, instead of dragging out the conversations to make people hang up in frustration.DON'T USE EXPEDIA!!!

When we went to check-out, the shuttle fee ($62) was not being waived. We called , the man on the phone was helpful and explained that he didn’t know why the fee wasn’t being waived, but if we booked through him, he would make sure we got our free shuttle. Great. So we booked with him over the phone, despite the fact that we get more money back (in  points) when booking online.', 'The  customer service man said he would contact our resort and arrange our transportation and email us when this was done. Great. I get an email saying that  is in process of setting up our transportation and we will hear from them in 24 hours. Great. I get an email 3 DAYS later saying that the resort doesn’t do free shuttles and we are out of luck. I have NO problem with the resort we booked, this is all ’s error.  FALSELY advertised the free shuttle. Which is honestly fine with me, as long as they would make it right and pay for our shuttle.My husband proceeds to call customer service again. He was passed between 3 people and on the phone for 2 hours, 1.5 of those hours being on hold. The first customer service woman was helpful, apologized for their mistake and offered $100 credit on our account, but we would still need to pay the $62 for the shuttle. My husband kindly asked, \"Can you just please waive the shuttle fee.\" She transferred him to the next level. The next customer service guy wasn’t helpful at all and passed my husband to the next level.This woman at the next level accused my husband of lying about what the first customer service representative said (about the $100 credit) saying this wasn’t ’s policy to do that. She told him there was nothing she could do and didn’t apologize for the false advertising on their website. The only offering she finally gave him was to send  a detailed receipt of our taxi and they would refund us for ONE way, not both ways to and from the airport. HOWEVER, my husband then explained that in Mexico, you generally don’t get a receipt and we prefer the shuttle, as it feels safer. She continued to be rude, unhelpful and offer no solution.While this complaint is over a measly $62 dollars, it came down to the feeling that  gave us. We have always loved booking our vacations through them because of the crazy bundle deals. Now, HOURS of our time have been wasted on the phone, and when we were able to talk to people, we were accused of lying. This might sound petty, but we will NEVER use  again, because of how they treated us.

He reported it to the front office and the manager came in with IT technician to check the door lock, which showed a housekeeper opened the lock at 9:05am and my husband came to open it again at 9:43am. We were asking local Zurich polices to investigate and also do a request fingerprint search + floor hallway camera search but both sides (hotel manager and 3 police officers) denied my request. The hotel manager brought the housekeeper who serviced my room and her supervisor in but of course that lady said \"NO\", even though her face looked very pale. After more than an hour interviewing ours and that lady (separately), everything was gone. And then, late that evening I got a police report like that: \"Die unbekannte Taterschaft entwendet Bargeld aus einer Umhangetasche, wetche im Hotelzimmer auf dem Burotisch abgestellt war. Sie fluchtet unerkannt in unbekannte Richtung.\"\\r\\nI brought this to get translate from all customers in Lobby they all shook their head on this story. After 45 minutes have passed after the incident happened, the front end manager and 3 local police officers could not find out who is and all customers in lobby said those officers + manager tried to cover up to their employee. When police officers and the manager were in our room, I told them this: I had been through many many hotels for much traveling and that I made a big mistake to put my #1 trust in this 5 star Marriott hotel and also to very honest Switzerland people while all of them were ready to betray mine. Even though there was proof from when the IT technician retrieved the data of the times when the door lock was opened which showed the housekeeper was the one who came into my room in that time frame, they claimed that they could not find any conclusion. I showed the police report to everyone and all have had big laugh on it. How about yours?? I would need more opinions about this. All though will be very much appreciated.']\n"

Male (and almost exclusively only male) customers are often reported by other users or my .com employees for \"verbally harassing\" other members, even when they do not communicate with other members at all. While other members\\' reporting may be simply a trolling or revenge practice (resulting from a lack of interest received from male members), .com employee reporting is a practice directly supported by the company itself. One of the most active corporate-sponsored scammers works under the name \"Tony E.\".Following the completely fake, unfounded accusation(s), the merchant terminates the unsuspecting users\\' account, without looking into the facts or giving any explanation, falsely citing the male user\\'s supposed behavior, while providing no evidence whatsoever, of it. The merchant hides behind its reference to \"privacy policy\" and typically gets away with wrongfully terminating the account with zero explanation or proof of alleged activity given.The merchant then collects the funds for partial or no service rendered, as the terminated member does not get reimbursed for the remainder of the the original, pre-paid subscription term, often at a value in excess of hundreds of dollars. The customer service center refuses to answer inquiries from the wrongfully terminated member, hangs up on the caller, states that it has no relationship with the corporate office itself, which supposedly decides over investigation or cancellations. The only step it recommends is to email the corporate office - but the corporate office refuses to respond to emails altogether.Curiously, though, this scamming practice includes the invitation of user to open up another, brand new account, effectively paying again for the already-purchased service.(!)

At the end of the 3-month period, a new charge for .com appeared on my credit card statement for a new 3-month subscription. I have had this experience before with other companies and realized, somewhere in the small print, I had evidently agreed to let them automatically charge me for a new subscription on my credit card. Whenever I've contacted other companies in this situation and explained I did not have a desire to renew, they have always cheerfully refunded my money and cancelled the subscription (Barnes & Noble membership and American Greetings membership are two companies that come to mind). But when I called .com, the representative refused to issue a full refund to me. (She did offer a partial refund, but I would still be paying a significant part of the whole charge.) She was very adamant about it. I told her I had never had this experience before with other companies. I asked to speak to her supervisor, and she told me i could not because the supervisor would tell me the same thing and so it would do no good. I was absolutely floored. This was some of the poorest customer experience I had ever experienced. During the conversation I mentioned I would be writing a negative review of .com. This did not seem to phase her. After she told me I could not talk to her supervisor, I said I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau. At this point, she asked if she could put me on hold to review my account. A little while later she came back on and told me sweetly I would be fully refunded (which afterward I was). Obviously, the BBB threat (which I carried out) must have caught her attention.

My subscription expired on 12/29/17 and auto-renewed at $119 inexplicably.', 'I called the  customer service two times on 1/2/18 to explain the situation. I was told that their system did not show I cancelled the membership and was asked if I had an email confirmation. At the time, I could not find the email, but I told both representatives I was telling the truth and cancelled back in June 2017, and my conscience would not let me lie if I truly forgot to cancel on my own. They told me the best they could do would be to refund me $60, and informed me I would not be able to speak with a manager. They then proceeded to end the call when I was not satisfied with only being refunded half, since I should not have been charged at all.After those two calls, I searched through my email and finally found the email confirmation dated 6/28/17 showing that I successfully cancelled my membership. I then called back and spoke with a third .com representative and informed her that I found my email. She placed me on hold and looked up my account information. She then informed me she could see I cancelled my account on 6/28/17; however, she indicated I reactivated my account the following day on 6/29/17.This is very troubling for a few reasons: 1) I never reactivated my account. She said it\\'s not as simple as mistakenly clicking the \"reactivate\" link in the email and that several steps would have been taken. I had no reason to reactivate the account the following day because I knew I absolutely did not want to renew, which is why I was proactive and cancelled my membership. 2) The first two customer service representatives informed me that they could not see on their end any cancellation that previously occurred. It was not until I finally found the email confirmation and spoke to the third representative did they inform me that they could see the cancellation that was previously made.I informed the third representative that I did not reactivate my account and informed her I never received an email confirming my reactivation, since they previously informed me they needed my cancellation email. She then placed me on hold, and then informed me that they do not send email confirmations for reactivations after I asked for one. This is very troubling because the first two representatives informed me that I needed to have the email confirmation for the cancellation, which at the time, I could not provide. Then, when I finally found the email, I was then told that I reactivated my account, but .com does not send email confirmations for that. So .com is holding customers to a standard that they themselves do not hold themselves to as far as providing email documentation.In conclusion, I subscribed to .com in June 2017. I knew I did not want to auto-renew once the subscription expired, so I was proactive and followed the steps to cancel my membership upon the expiration date of 12/29/17. I was provided an email confirmation of my cancellation dated 6/28/17. I was subsequently charged an auto-renewal fee of $119. I called and spoke with two representatives who informed me the only thing they could do was refund me $60, since their system showed I never cancelled my membership, and I could not provide the email confirmation of the cancellation at the time. I finally found the email confirmation of the cancellation minutes later and called back and spoke with a third representative.Unlike the previous two representatives, she informed me she could see in the system that I cancelled the membership on 6/28/17 (which the previous two representatives failed to mention), but she then indicated that I auto-renewed the following day on 6/29/17. I absolutely did not auto-renew, as I immediately knew upon subscribing that I did not want that to happen, which is why I cancelled. Each representative informed me they could only refund me $60, and informed me that I could not speak with a manager because the manager would relay the same message.I am very troubled by this situation, as I have never been treated like this by a company before. I feel like I was scammed out of the remainder of the $119 charged to my credit card and was deceived by the customer service agents who did not inform me of their knowledge of the initial cancellation. I have an email confirmation confirming my cancellation, which shows I was telling the truth. Now, I\\'m being told I reactivated my account, which is completely false. The only way this issue can be resolved is to receive a complete refund for the $119 that I am owed and would like assistance with making this right.

They robbed my chance of talking to someone that I found very interesting, though it's very possible that the activity sent to my account was entirely fake and generated by .com to be fooled into buying service. Seeing how, not even moments after signing up I receive allegedly all this winks, profile likes, and private messages, from real users, which I find it hard to believe I got all that activity within my first 10 minutes of using the site with a incomplete profile. Then after buying services I could respond to these items. But then suddenly without warning my account is terminated, and I have to get a refund, thankfully, I paid through paypal and have buyer protection. If your looking for dating sites, I wouldn't put .com any where near my choices, and I will never recommend this site to anyone, and anyone asking about this site, I will tell them the very short experience I had with it.\", 'if your subscription is renewed automatically, even if you call them on the day it happened, they will not issue you a refund, not even a partial refund. This happened to me and a girl i was dating. So you are charged a full price for 6 months.

I tried to contact customer service, but it was Friday after 4 p.m. PST, and their offices are only open during business hours CST, M-F!  After difficulty even finding a phone number, I called them on Monday, and was told me that a refund was \"blocked\" because I had sent ONE message (to be sure my subscription was still in effect).  They refused to refund the UNUSED PORTION of my subscription (two months and three weeks) for the same silly reason, as if computers are unable to calculate the portion remaining.  It\\'s another dating SCAM.', 'I stopped using the website but then I found a $71 USD charge on my credit card. .com automatically charged me a 3 month renewal fee of $71 USD two days earlier. I received no email notice from them leading up to the automatic payment.

In summary they charged me $51 for a service I did not use.', \"My account got hacked!  Some lady put two photos on my profile, messaged a whole lot of people, 'liked' people I wouldn't of 'liked', and then blocked a whole bunch. Not a very secure site apparently.

But lets face we all rely on these sites as where else is there to go to meet men and women that you are looking for to spend the rest of your life with surly not a bar. So  is not the only one they are all  guilty  of it zoosk, plenty of fish, our time, Udate, MeetMindful,  senior dating and dating 50 and over. And many more I am sure. This is wrong to get peoples hopes up and take their money when all they want to do is find love. They should all have to give you a 7 day trail to look at the site for free to see if what they are saying is true. And if it is then charge the person but to take money and all the people they show you are hundreds of miles away your not going to find love that way lets be  realistic .', \"Everyone is complaining about you for your systems.

We can\\'t do anything about it.\"', 'So I was like, \"Eh it\\'s ok. It\\'s not your fault. You guys dont control the website.\" So I go on their online chat system and I talk to this guy.

Fine.\" So the next day no email. Day after I\\'m like, \"Ok I\\'ll call.\" They answer and say, \"No. No one put in for rush shipping. Your order isnt ready,\" aaaaand, \"The machine is broken.\" So I\\'m like, \"Ok. Fine. Can you guys just do a big poster then instead of a canvas.\" They say no and that I should get a refund and try other stores. \\'s a waste of time.

Every time they saw Santa (and anyone else who would ask) they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for. They have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift.\\r\\n I went to  to purchase one and it was not available in the store, but a helpful assistant informed me I could order it online for store pickup before Christmas. I thought this was awesome and right there in the store I ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of Friday, December 22nd. Just in time for Christmas! I was so happy I had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes. \\r\\nOn Friday, December 22nd I went to the pickup counter of my local  to get their Christmas presents. And the bikes were not there. I was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until Tuesday, December 26th the day after Christmas. \\r\\nThis was of course a huge let down. I stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated DELIVERY BY FRIDAY DECEMBER 22nd in big bold font. and could not process what he was telling me. What would I do for Christmas?! Right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop. How could I explain to my girls that Santa was not going to bring them what they wanted? What was I going to do? The man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma  put me in and informed me there was nothing I could do but call 1800. He did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me. \\r\\nI immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store. The first women I talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly. I asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy I was transferred to was a complete $#*!. He had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as I sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save Christmas for my children. \\r\\nFinally, he was able to transfer me to someone in another department. This women was the first person I spoke to who was empathetic. She patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as I frantically tried to picture how I would explain to my daughters that Santa was not able to deliver their gifts. I asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on Tuesday. She gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience I was experiencing. \\r\\n As I sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a  employee named Bradley working at the pickup counter. He was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone.  Unlike the first man I encountered at the store, Bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could. He even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other  in the phoenix metro area. I was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone. Unfortunately,  and every other major store did not carry this item in stores. \\r\\nBradley sat there with me and listened as I cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how I felt like such a failure because I was letting my girls down. He came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets, kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming.\\r\\nChristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents, including the helmets, kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for. I explained to them that Santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on Tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at  where Santa had them waiting just for us. \\r\\nI received an email from .com Tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at . I packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see Santas special delivery with plans to pick up Maddie afterward and test out the new bikes.\\r\\nWhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there. I told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one. He went in the back to get a manager as I pulled up the email clearly stating Quantity: 2. My old friend Bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came. Disappointed, and trying to figure out how I was going to explain to Maddie that Santa only had one bike not two at the store  I left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to  to pick up this impossibly challenging Christmas present. \\r\\nLater that day I got a voicemail from Bradley as I was putting my kids down for their naps. He let me know that the bike had arrived, but that I was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded. \\r\\nHe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the .com phone number for me, explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone. The people he spoke to on the phone told him I had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what I was told when I called customer service on 12/22. \\r\\nLuckily, my children were napping, because once again the tears came pouring down my face as I tried to understand what was going on. I called 1800 and was transferred three times until I began to speak with Kiki. Who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution. \\r\\nShe informed me that while the third person I spoke to on 12/22  Allison  may have told me I would get a refund and the bikes  - that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes. As Allison was not working today, she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now. I am aware that calls are recorded  so I was very frustrated that this phone call from 12/22 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me. She let me know the only way I would be getting the bike was if I went in and re-purchased them. Which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point.\\r\\nCurrently -  the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the  pickup counter.  It seems Santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents, which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when Santa promised them two. \\r\\nAt this point -  has robbed me of hours of my life. I have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 12/22 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today. I have traveled to  to try to get the bikes three separate times (with a 1 and 3 year old  that is SO easy).  I have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways I can still make this gift magical for my girls.\\r\\nThe irony of this situation is that I choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a  employee. Instead, this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life. The additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin. \\r\\nI have come up with a solution to try to save Christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls. \\r\\nNot only do I want you to release the bike promised to me on 12/22 for pick up, I also think Ella and Maddie deserve bells and bike tassels on their new bikes for their patience. If you could figure out a way to have Santa deliver it even better. \\r\\nSincerely, \\r\\nAndrea Hogan', \"Well, I was at  again a few days before Xmas.

They promise you leads, yet do not provide leads, you call and ask them to cancel then they tell you that one: The leads are probably in your spam box and two: you had a verbal contract with them and you are now in a contract for a year. They continue to bill your account, we even canceled the card on file and they still billed our account telling us, that they have a way to bill through your bank account as a merchant account, even after you change the card.  This is a total scam and the most unprofessional form of business we have seen in the Real Estate profession.', \"(Update on Class Action Suit Below) We decided to try .com leads, since they are based on active listings only.  Plus we thought they were associated with the NAR.  We were wrong.  Their leads were horrible, and their contract was very different than what we were promised.  We were told we could cancel anytime, but that's not the case.  They were terrible at responding, and rude when we brought up issues.  Some of the leads they sent were for out of state zipcodes.  The rest were for trailers in parks.  A total of maybe 6 leads in three months - all terrible. It was a very expensive mistake.  We will stick with Zillow.\\n\\n** Please contact me if you signed up with .com and received fake leads, no leads or less than you were promised from their services.\", 'Looking for e in  Miami area  I recommend  in touch with Daria Teyubov  from Red square Realty , I live out of state contacted her after a long  search\\r\\nDaria go out of her way to help her clients,she found me the buyer Handled\\r\\nAll the building requirements including repairs and maintenance ...\\r\\nShe has a solution to any problem.\\r\\ni dealet with a lot of   Great agent but no one went out of  there a way  like Daria.', \"I'm in the same boat!

The place was in great shape on our last day of lease and we walked the whole condo with the landlord and both signed the paper saying \"everything is good\" and she still used our deposit. That we initially have to her, she used it to put new blinds on the windows, to pay a company to come in and tear up the brand new carpet off the basement floor...she should have bought a new dishwasher, that one sucks. The landlord had cheap already broken blinds on the windows when we moved in and no screens on the windows, but we didn\\'t complain...trying to be good tenants. She ripped us off and now is trying to charge $600 more than what we paid for rent. Good luck with that....maybe if they were stainless steel appliances but they aren\\'t.

Not only was Ozzie a man of his word by working hard to get our family home sold, it sold in 3 days!

He explained that we arent signing a contract but they just hope we will stay in it and try it for a year. I said Id give it 3 months and reevaluate it since we arent signing a contract anyway. After 3 months of hardly any leads and the couple we got were bogus, we called the customer service number to cancel. The person we got on the phone said hes not able to cancel but someone in client care could help and someone would call us back. I told him I will stay on the line until he could get someone on the phone who could help. After 45 minutes we finally got to talk to the RUDEST guy and he said he wont cancel ourcontract. I asked him what contract?? We didnt sign anything and to prove it otherwise. He proceeded to yell at me and told me he cant come over to my computer and show me how to use my email!!!! He was trying his best to bully us and try and convince us we had to continue to pay. We didnt give up and he finally sent us a cancellation email because we had to not stop arguing with him. He tried to tell us we have a verbal contract and I told him to find the recording of my conversation because I never agreed to any contract. HORRIBLE experience and company!!!!!! This business should be shut down. Do yourself a favor and dont use them. There are a lot better ways of getting clients', 'I used .com for leads for over 10 months and never had a viable lead to do a deal with.

santa and anyone else who would ask they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for they have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift\\r\\n i went to  to purchase one and it was not available in the store but a helpful assistant informed me i could order it online for store pickup before christmas i thought this was awesome and right there in the store i ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of friday december 22nd just in time for christmas i was so happy i had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes \\r\\non friday december 22nd i went to the pickup counter of my local  to get their christmas presents and the bikes were not there i was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until tuesday december 26th the day after christmas \\r\\nthis was of course a huge let down i stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated delivery by friday december 22nd in big bold font and could not process what he was telling me what would i do for christmas right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop how could i explain to my girls that santa was not going to bring them what they wanted what was i going to do the man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma  put me in and informed me there was nothing i could do but call 1800 he did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me \\r\\ni immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store the first women i talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly i asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy i was transferred to was a complete  he had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as i sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save christmas for my children \\r\\nfinally he was able to transfer me to someone in another department this women was the first person i spoke to who was empathetic she patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as i frantically tried to picture how i would explain to my daughters that santa was not able to deliver their gifts i asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on tuesday she gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience i was experiencing \\r\\n as i sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a  employee named bradley working at the pickup counter he was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone  unlike the first man i encountered at the store bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could he even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other  in the phoenix metro area i was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone unfortunately  and every other major store did not carry this item in stores \\r\\nbradley sat there with me and listened as i cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how i felt like such a failure because i was letting my girls down he came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming\\r\\nchristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents including the helmets kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for i explained to them that santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at  where santa had them waiting just for us \\r\\ni received an email from com tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at  i packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see santas special delivery with plans to pick up maddie afterward and test out the new bikes\\r\\nwhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there i told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one he went in the back to get a manager as i pulled up the email clearly stating quantity 2 my old friend bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came disappointed and trying to figure out how i was going to explain to maddie that santa only had one bike not two at the store  i left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to  to pick up this impossibly challenging christmas present \\r\\nlater that day i got a voicemail from bradley as i was putting my kids down for their naps he let me know that the bike had arrived but that i was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded \\r\\nhe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the com phone number for me explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone the people he spoke to on the phone told him i had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what i was told when i called customer service on 1222 \\r\\nluckily my children were napping because once again the tears came pouring down my face as i tried to understand what was going on i called 1800 and was transferred three times until i began to speak with kiki who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution \\r\\nshe informed me that while the third person i spoke to on 1222  allison  may have told me i would get a refund and the bikes   that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes as allison was not working today she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now i am aware that calls are recorded  so i was very frustrated that this phone call from 1222 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me she let me know the only way i would be getting the bike was if i went in and repurchased them which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point\\r\\ncurrently   the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the  pickup counter  it seems santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when santa promised them two \\r\\nat this point   has robbed me of hours of my life i have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 1222 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today i have traveled to  to try to get the bikes three separate times with a 1 and 3 year old  that is so easy  i have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways i can still make this gift magical for my girls\\r\\nthe irony of this situation is that i choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a  employee instead this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life the additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin \\r\\ni have come up with a solution to try to save christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls \\r\\nnot only do i want you to release the bike promised to me on 1222 for pick

best they could do would be to refund me 60 and informed me i would not be able to speak with a manager they then proceeded to end the call when i was not satisfied with only being refunded half since i should not have been charged at allafter those two calls i searched through my email and finally found the email confirmation dated 62817 showing that i successfully cancelled my membership i then

my account on 62817 however she indicated i reactivated my account the following day on 62917this is very troubling for a few reasons 1 i never reactivated my account she said its not as simple as mistakenly clicking the reactivate link in the email and that several steps would have been taken i had no reason to reactivate the account the following day because i knew i absolutely did not want to renew which is why i was proactive and cancelled my membership 2 the first two customer service representatives informed me that they could not see on their end any cancellation that previously occurred it was not until i finally found the email confirmation and spoke to the third representative did they inform me that they could see the cancellation that was previously madei informed the third representative that i did not reactivate my account and informed her i never received an email confirming my reactivation since they previously informed me they needed my cancellation email she then placed me on hold and then informed me that they do not send email confirmations for reactivations after i asked for one this is very troubling because the first two representatives informed me that i needed to have the email confirmation for the cancellation which at the time i could not provide then when i finally found the email i was then told that i reactivated my account but com does not send email confirmations for that so com is holding customers to a standard that they themselves do not hold themselves to as far as providing email documentationin conclusion i subscribed to com

refund me 60 since their system showed i never cancelled my membership and i could not provide the email confirmation of the cancellation at the time i finally found the email confirmation of the cancellation minutes later and called back and spoke with a third representativeunlike the previous two representatives she informed me she could see in the system that i cancelled the membership on 62817 which the previous two representatives failed to mention but she then indicated that i autorenewed the following day on 62917 i absolutely did not autorenew as i immediately knew upon subscribing that i did not want that to happen which is why i cancelled each representative informed me they could only refund me 60 and informed me that i could not speak with a manager because the manager would relay the same messagei am very troubled by this situation as i have never been treated like this by a company before i feel like i was scammed out of the remainder of the 119 charged to my credit card and was deceived by the customer service agents who did not inform me of their knowledge of the initial cancellation i have an email confirmation confirming my cancellation which shows i was telling the truth now im being told i reactivated my account which is completely false the only way this issue can be resolved is to receive a complete refund for the 119 that i am owed and

tracking number from ups is beyond me i also dont understand why the local  wasnt able to give me the same information that com had which resulted in me having to contact com', 'i proceeded to call com and besides receiving the tracking number they were able to tell me that it looks as if the product i ordered on the 16th was going to arrive in the camillus store on the 26th they also told me that the product i ordered for my wife was actually in syracuse as of 200am on the 23rd of december when i called ups to ask why it would take until tuesday the 26th to have my package delivered to the  in camillus i was told that it could take up to 10 business days and since this was a land package they dont deliver on sundays or holidays hence why my package wont get to  until this tuesday december 26 merry christmasups was nice enough to let me know that com did not transmit the order to ups until three days later or december 19th in this day and age of technology that is unwarranted had com processed the order right away there would have been a good possibility that my wifes package would have arrived on timewhat bothers me the most is the breakdown in communications from com never once did they indicate in the email i received with my order confirmation that the delivery could take up to 10 business days nor did they offer me an option to expedite for the right price i would have paid for quicker shipping or i would have gone to amazoncom where i have never had an issue with timely delivery after reading some of the complaints on the consumer affairs website it is clear to me that i am not the only one who has been impacted by poor communication needless to say this will be the last time i ever order something from com one more disappointed customer', 'so i

had enough to get for 7 granddaughters anyhow the cashier said lets try it again and it was denied again so i stepped aside to call about my account and it said i only had 74 in my account this is not

returned to the long line again to tell the lady what they said she was not too happy and repeated what she said to me before that there was no charges taken from my card because it was denied she called for someone by the name of eric to double check it and he agreed with her so i told my husband what they said and once again he called bank the bank ended up calling the  to speak with her i waited and waited with nothing from this woman at all finally i asked her what the bank had to say and she says they just asked a couple of questions and hung up not true and she could have called me up to the desk again as i was off to the side waiting all this time an hour and a half i waited for her to do nothing with one of my granddaughters she called an assistant manager on the phone and then told me there was nothing she could do well by this time my husband has called back to tell me that the bank tried talking to them and telling them that it shows they did in fact double charge me

christmas my 3 year old daughter ella  and 3 year old god daughter maddie asked santa for balance bikes every time they saw santa and anyone else who would ask they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for they have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift\\r\\n i went to  to purchase one and it was not available in the store but a helpful assistant informed me i could order it online for store pickup before christmas i thought this was awesome and right there in the store i ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of friday december 22nd just in time for christmas i was so happy i had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes \\r\\non friday december 22nd i went to the pickup counter of my local  to get their christmas presents and the bikes were not there i was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until tuesday december 26th the day after christmas \\r\\nthis was of course a huge let down i stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated delivery by friday december 22nd in big bold font and could not process what he was telling me what would i do for christmas right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop how could i explain to my girls that santa was not going to bring them what they wanted what was i going to do the man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma  put me in and informed me there was nothing i could do but call 1800 he did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me \\r\\ni immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store the first women i talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly i asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy i was transferred to was a complete  he had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as i sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save christmas for my children \\r\\nfinally he was able to transfer me to someone in another department this women was the first person i spoke to who was empathetic she patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as i frantically tried to picture how i would explain to my daughters that santa was not able to deliver their gifts i asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on tuesday she gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience i was experiencing \\r\\n as i sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a  employee named bradley working at the pickup counter he was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone  unlike the first man i encountered at the store bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could he even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other  in the phoenix metro area i was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone unfortunately  and every other major store did not carry this item in stores \\r\\nbradley sat there with me and listened as i cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how i felt like such a failure because i was letting my girls down he came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming\\r\\nchristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents including the helmets kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for i explained to them that santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at  where santa had them waiting just for us \\r\\ni received an email from com tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at  i packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see santas special delivery with plans to pick up maddie afterward and test out the new bikes\\r\\nwhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there i told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one he went in the back to get a manager as i pulled up the email clearly stating quantity 2 my old friend bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came disappointed and trying to figure out how i was going to explain to maddie that santa only had one bike not two at the store  i left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to  to pick up this impossibly challenging christmas present \\r\\nlater that day i got a voicemail from bradley as i was putting my kids down for their naps he let me know that the bike had arrived but that i was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded \\r\\nhe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the com phone number for me explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone the people he spoke to on the phone told him i had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what i was told when i called customer service on 1222 \\r\\nluckily my children were napping because once again the tears came pouring down my face as i tried to understand what was going on i called 1800 and was transferred three times until i began to speak with kiki who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution \\r\\nshe informed me that while the third person i spoke to on 1222  allison  may have told me i would get a refund and the bikes   that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes as allison was not working today she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now i am aware that calls are recorded  so i was very frustrated that this phone call from 1222 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me she let me know the only way i would be getting the bike was if i went in and repurchased them which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point\\r\\ncurrently   the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the  pickup counter  it seems santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when santa promised them two \\r\\nat this point   has robbed me of hours of my life i have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 1222 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today i have traveled to  to try to get the bikes three separate times with a 1 and 3 year old  that is so easy  i have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways i can still make this gift magical for my girls\\r\\nthe irony of this situation is that i choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a  employee instead this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life the additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin \\r\\ni have come up with a solution to try to save christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls \\r\\nnot only do i want you to release the bike promised to me on 1222 for pick up i also think ella and maddie deserve bells and bike tassels on their new bikes for their patience if you could figure out a way to have santa deliver it even better \\r\\nsincerely \\r\\nandrea hogan', 'well i was at  again a few days before xmas  you would think especially at

they just couldnt be bothered with and then the rude woman at pick up says i cant have that particular item i would need to cancel it off my order and pay for it right then and therethey said it would have to be shipped in when i holding the item in my handbecause i had to go get it myselfwoware you kidding mei dont care what the reason is at all period you are screwing your loyal customers overa

santa and anyone else who would ask they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for they have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift\\r\\n i went to  to purchase one and it was not available in the store but a helpful assistant informed me i could order it online for store pickup before christmas i thought this was awesome and right there in the store i ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of friday december 22nd just in time for christmas i was so happy i had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes \\r\\non friday december 22nd i went to the pickup counter of my local  to get their christmas presents and the bikes were not there i was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until tuesday december 26th the day after christmas \\r\\nthis was of course a huge let down i stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated delivery by friday december 22nd in big bold font and could not process what he was telling me what would i do for christmas right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop how could i explain to my girls that santa was not going to bring them what they wanted what was i going to do the man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma  put me in and informed me there was nothing i could do but call 1800 he did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me \\r\\ni immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store the first women i talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly i asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy i was transferred to was a complete  he had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as i sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save christmas for my children \\r\\nfinally he was able to transfer me to someone in another department this women was the first person i spoke to who was empathetic she patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as i frantically tried to picture how i would explain to my daughters that santa was not able to deliver their gifts i asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on tuesday she gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience i was experiencing \\r\\n as i sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a  employee named bradley working at the pickup counter he was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone  unlike the first man i encountered at the store bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could he even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other  in the phoenix metro area i was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone unfortunately  and every other major store did not carry this item in stores \\r\\nbradley sat there with me and listened as i cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how i felt like such a failure because i was letting my girls down he came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming\\r\\nchristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents including the helmets kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for i explained to them that santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at  where santa had them waiting just for us \\r\\ni received an email from com tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at  i packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see santas special delivery with plans to pick up maddie afterward and test out the new bikes\\r\\nwhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there i told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one he went in the back to get a manager as i pulled up the email clearly stating quantity 2 my old friend bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came disappointed and trying to figure out how i was going to explain to maddie that santa only had one bike not two at the store  i left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to  to pick up this impossibly challenging christmas present \\r\\nlater that day i got a voicemail from bradley as i was putting my kids down for their naps he let me know that the bike had arrived but that i was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded \\r\\nhe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the com phone number for me explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone the people he spoke to on the phone told him i had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what i was told when i called customer service on 1222 \\r\\nluckily my children were napping because once again the tears came pouring down my face as i tried to understand what was going on i called 1800 and was transferred three times until i began to speak with kiki who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution \\r\\nshe informed me that while the third person i spoke to on 1222  allison  may have told me i would get a refund and the bikes   that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes as allison was not working today she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now i am aware that calls are recorded  so i was very frustrated that this phone call from 1222 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me she let me know the only way i would be getting the bike was if i went in and repurchased them which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point\\r\\ncurrently   the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the  pickup counter  it seems santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when santa promised them two \\r\\nat this point   has robbed me of hours of my life i have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 1222 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today i have traveled to  to try to get the bikes three separate times with a 1 and 3 year old  that is so easy  i have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways i can still make this gift magical for my girls\\r\\nthe irony of this situation is that i choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a  employee instead this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life the additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin \\r\\ni have come up with a solution to try to save christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls \\r\\nnot only do i want you to release the bike promised to me on 1222 for pick up i also think ella and maddie deserve bells and bike tassels on their new bikes for their patience if you could figure out a way to have santa deliver it even better \\r\\nsincerely \\r\\nandrea

waived we called  the man on the phone was helpful and explained that he didn’t know why the fee wasn’t being waived but if we booked through him he would make sure we got our free shuttle great so we

not even offer partial refunds there is no way to know who is actually really available on this site so you will waste your time looking through countless accounts that either will never receive your

happened at the end of the 6 months guess what they billed me again i called them and told them this has to be refunded to which they replied that they can offer a partial refund for 1 month of

bought a 6 month membership this time i took a screenshot of the autopay cancellation screen i also saved the email confirmation that stated that i had successfully cancelled the autopay fast forward to last week they billed me for another 6 months i called them and it took a while to find their number i asked the guy to refund me he said no he could give me a partial refund for one month because there was no evidence i had cancelled i told him that this sounded extremely familiar but this time i had a screenshot of the cancellation page he asked for a confirmation number for cancellation i read him the entire email from 6 months earlier where  confirmed i cancelled no confirmation number then i looked the email he just send me to give me a partial refund and you guessed it also had no confirmationhe knew i could not have had a confirmation number because they do not give one by email i told him to send me to a supervisor he responded he could not there was no supervisor there he also said he could not give a full refund because there was no way to do that i told him this was fraud twice and that he was getting me angry i told him to refund the cost or i would take legal action even if the action cost me 10 times more than the  payment he put me on hold not sure why since there was supposed to be no supervisor and when he returned everything was refunded these people

christmas my 3 year old daughter ella  and 3 year old god daughter maddie asked santa for balance bikes every time they saw santa and anyone else who would ask they happily said this was the one item they could not wait for they have been being extra good in hopes of this special gift\\r\\n i went to  to purchase one and it was not available in the store but a helpful assistant informed me i could order it online for store pickup before christmas i thought this was awesome and right there in the store i ordered two pink balance bikes on my phone with a pickup date of friday december 22nd just in time for christmas i was so happy i had this convenient option and could not wait to pick up the bikes \\r\\non friday december 22nd i went to the pickup counter of my local  to get their christmas presents and the bikes were not there i was informed at the pickup counter that they would not be delivered until tuesday december 26th the day after christmas \\r\\nthis was of course a huge let down i stood there and stared blankly at the man at the pickup counter and then at my phone  with the email that clearly stated delivery by friday december 22nd in big bold font and could not process what he was telling me what would i do for christmas right there in front of everyone in the pickup section of the store the tears came and would not stop how could i explain to my girls that santa was not going to bring them what they wanted what was i going to do the man at the pickup counter could not care less about the dilemma  put me in and informed me there was nothing i could do but call 1800 he did not even offer an apology and quickly wrote done the number to get rid of me \\r\\ni immediately called the customer service number right there in the pickup section of the store the first women i talked to was able to offer no solutions and seemed to be trying to get through the call hurriedly i asked to speak to her manager  and the next guy i was transferred to was a complete  he had no emotions in is voice and it felt like he was reading off of a script as i sat there crying on the phone with him asking him to help me find a solution and try to help me save christmas for my children \\r\\nfinally he was able to transfer me to someone in another department this women was the first person i spoke to who was empathetic she patiently listened to me as the stress of the holidays vomited out of my mouth in the form of dry heaving cries as i frantically tried to picture how i would explain to my daughters that santa was not able to deliver their gifts i asked to receive a refund for the bikes for this dilemma and still receive the bikes on tuesday she gladly processed this and apologized for the inconvenience i was experiencing \\r\\n as i sat in a bench in the pickup counter of the store ugly crying to this women on the phone  there was a  employee named bradley working at the pickup counter he was kind enough to give me sympathetic glances as he overheard this conversation on the phone  unlike the first man i encountered at the store bradley was willing and eager to help me in any way he could he even started looking on his phone to see if this item was at any other  in the phoenix metro area i was also frantically trying to search for anywhere that sold balance bikes in the area on my phone unfortunately  and every other major store did not carry this item in stores \\r\\nbradley sat there with me and listened as i cried to him about the pressures of being a perfect mom around the holidays and how i felt like such a failure because i was letting my girls down he came up with the great idea of having me purchase helmets kneepads and elbow pads and wrapping those up with a printed picture of the bike so my girls knew it was coming\\r\\nchristmas came and my daughters opened up their presents including the helmets kneepads and elbow pads and they were ecstatic when they learned they were getting the bikes they asked for i explained to them that santa wanted them to pick it up in the store themselves and that we were going to go on tuesday to get them at the pickup counter at  where santa had them waiting just for us \\r\\ni received an email from com tuesday morning detailing that my order was ready for pickup at  i packed up my 1 year old son and my 3 year old daughter and off we went to go see santas special delivery with plans to pick up maddie afterward and test out the new bikes\\r\\nwhen we arrived we found out that only one bike was there i told the guy at the counter that the order was for two bikes not one he went in the back to get a manager as i pulled up the email clearly stating quantity 2 my old friend bradley came out and informed me that only one bike had made it to the store and the other one was being delivered later in the day and that he would personally call me when it came disappointed and trying to figure out how i was going to explain to maddie that santa only had one bike not two at the store  i left to go home and wait for a call to head for a third time to  to pick up this impossibly challenging christmas present \\r\\nlater that day i got a voicemail from bradley as i was putting my kids down for their naps he let me know that the bike had arrived but that i was not allowed to come pick it up because it was not being released for pick up because the order was refunded \\r\\nhe was nice about this and even let me know that he tried to call the com phone number for me explaining the situation to everyone he spoke to on the phone the people he spoke to on the phone told him i had to call and that the bikes should not be given to me if a refund was given which is not what i was told when i called customer service on 1222 \\r\\nluckily my children were napping because once again the tears came pouring down my face as i tried to understand what was going on i called 1800 and was transferred three times until i began to speak with kiki who was very empathetic and understanding to my problem  but was not able to offer me any solution \\r\\nshe informed me that while the third person i spoke to on 1222  allison  may have told me i would get a refund and the bikes   that the notes she wrote in the system only say that she processed the refund and nothing about me still receiving the bikes as allison was not working today she was unable to do anything further until another manager reviewed this incident number and that could be days from now i am aware that calls are recorded  so i was very frustrated that this phone call from 1222 could not simply be pulled up and listened to so it could be confirmed that was the solution offered to me she let me know the only way i would be getting the bike was if i went in and repurchased them which of course seemed like a sick joke at this point\\r\\ncurrently   the second bike is being held hostage from my daughter at the  pickup counter  it seems santa only cared enough to deliver one of my girls presents which has been such a fun thing to explain to two toddlers as they take turns riding only one bike when santa promised them two \\r\\nat this point   has robbed me of hours of my life i have spent 45 minutes on the phone on 1222 with customer service and 60 minutes on the phone today i have traveled to  to try to get the bikes three separate times with a 1 and 3 year old  that is so easy  i have spent hours crying over this and trying to creatively think of solutions to work around this inconvenience and ways i can still make this gift magical for my girls\\r\\nthe irony of this situation is that i choose to order this gift online for store pickup after hearing how easy it was from a  employee instead this experience has been by far the worse shopping experience of my life the additional stress this has caused me in an already stressful season is enough to put a person in the looney bin \\r\\ni have come up with a solution to try to save christmas and the magic of this much anticipated gift for my girls \\r\\nnot only do i want you to release the bike promised to me on 1222 for pick up i also think ella and maddie deserve bells and bike tassels on their new bikes for their patience if you could figure out a way to have santa deliver it even better \\r\\nsincerely \\r\\nandrea hogan', 'well i was at  again a few days before xmas  you would think especially at
