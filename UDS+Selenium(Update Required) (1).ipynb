      "['\\n            Awful, Terrfible, nightmare experience. I have been on the phone with the customer service for 5 hours for 2 days, trying to use my credits I have with them for American and Virgin. They kept telling me different info, having me call the airlines direct, then I find out it can only be used with Expedia - all in all, the customer service is horrible and it will literally take you hours and hours to have them get you some valid info, causing you waist about 5 hours in one day to book a flight. RIDICULOUS. NEVER USE THIS SITE.\\n        \\n            Had a terrible experience booking a car through Expedia.I booked a car for $380 on Expedia and was told this was the final price to be paid. Upon picking up the car I was told it was another $600... Customer service was terrible, never really replied and when they did, they managed to switch my name up to a woman\\'s name. Never will I use Expedia again\\n        \\n            Very dodgy, dodgy...After spending days traversing the various sites to find an affordable flight to a Caribbean destination, I saw what I thought was quite affordable being offered by Expedia. The only drawback, the flight was not direct but involved connecting flights. I thought that because of the savings it was worth the inconvenience.I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not- to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that. I immediately called Expedia and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this. And to make matters worse, after chasing Expedia for days, they offered me another connecting flight with an 8 hours waiting time between connection, without any form of compensation for my inconvenience.I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where Expedia and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare. IF EXPEDIA OR AIR CANADA WAS REALLY GENUINE ABOUT THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS/PASSENGERS WHY WAS I NOT OFFERED ONE OF THESE TRIPS. PROFITS PLACED AHEAD OF CUSTOMERS...THAT\\'S WHY.They are proper \"dodgy\" people. There must be some Consumer body to protect the rights of consumers, these people are getting away with what the common man would be \"brought to book\" for.Can you imagine. me getting into a contract with another party, the other party commits financially to it, then when I am to perform my end of the contract I renege. I would be sued for breach of contract. I think the same should apply to Expedia and Airlines that take people\\'s money for a trip and then change it at the last minute at a terrible financial consequence to the passenger.It is downright dishonesty.\\n        \\n            Is there a zero star option? Worst customer service ever. Called  over 5 times to solve a simple name change issue, placed on hold for a total of about 10 hours, was told by numerous agents that my problem was resolved, only to be told by the next agent that nothing\\'s been solved and there\\'s no record of any of the assurances I was given. I have used Expedia for the p ast 10 years and have recently had a series of deteriorating experiences, but this one takes the cake. I will do everything in my power to never use them again and ensure nobody else that I can influence does either. Total scam artists.\\n        \\n            my girl friend and i were planning a trip to boston. We used expedia to get our tickets at half the price form what the other sites had listed. we thought we had just scored, but when my girl friend filled out all our information she got an error message. She tried again, got the same message, and then switched which computer she was using. she got the same error message on the new computer. after getting this error message 4 times she decided to check her bank account to discover that they had placed a hold on her account for our two tickets 4 times despite the fact that we still did not have tickets. we called their customer service and the first man we spoke with just babbled at us on repeat until we asked for a suporvisor. the suporvisor asked a lot of pointed questions that really made it sound like it was our fault. one of her examples was that we made another purchase today and thats why were were missing $1500. once we finally proved to her that it was expedia that had over charged us she assured us it wasnt possible and that she could help. she asked to make the reservation again and we told her that there was no more money on the card and we didnt have another way to pay. regardless of our pleas the suporvisor set up our reservation a 5th time and when she was done the suporvisor recived the same error message my girlfriend had gotten. we checker her bank account and sure enough we were charged a 5th time. the suporvisor assured us all the charges would fall off by midnight. that was two days ago. yesterday we woke up to an email from expedia that apologized for the technical issues they were experiencing but the money was still on hold. today we woke up to discover that we did not get our money back and instead of the charges pending they have now gone through. expedia charged us over 1500 on tickets we didnt end up even getting. They assured us we would have our money back, but they took it. we called their customer service this morning but yet again they were useless and made it sound like it was our fault they took the money from us.

I was assured that they had now refunded the points to my card but this would take 7 days.  Yet again I waited over a week and nothing.  They should not be promising their customers Points when they do not allow you to use them.  This is fraud. I have never been refused redeeming points in say Sainsburys or Boots.  Expedia are liars.

I emailed Expedia again and I get the same type of email: contact your bank to \"verify the status of the charge.. if you have been charged, contact your bank.\"I am completely frustrated and will literally never use Expedia to book anything in the future.

I have been on the phone with the customer service for 5 hours for 2 days, trying to use my credits I have with them for American and Virgin. They kept telling me different info, having me call the airlines direct, then I find out it can only be used with Expedia - all in all, the customer service is horrible and it will literally take you hours and hours to have them get you some valid info, causing you waist about 5 hours in one day to book a flight. RIDICULOUS. NEVER USE THIS SITE.', \"Had a terrible experience booking a car through Expedia.I booked a car for $380 on Expedia and was told this was the final price to be paid. Upon picking up the car I was told it was another $600... Customer service was terrible, never really replied and when they did, they managed to switch my name up to a woman's name. Never will I use Expedia again\", 'Very dodgy, dodgy...After spending days traversing the various sites to find an affordable flight to a Caribbean destination, I saw what I thought was quite affordable being offered by Expedia. The only drawback, the flight was not direct but involved connecting flights. I thought that because of the savings it was worth the inconvenience.I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not- to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that. I immediately called Expedia and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this. And to make matters worse, after chasing Expedia for days, they offered me another connecting flight with an 8 hours waiting time between connection, without any form of compensation for my inconvenience.I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where Expedia and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare. IF EXPEDIA OR AIR CANADA WAS REALLY GENUINE ABOUT THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS/PASSENGERS WHY WAS I NOT OFFERED ONE OF THESE TRIPS. PROFITS PLACED AHEAD OF CUSTOMERS...THAT\\'S WHY.They are proper \"dodgy\" people. There must be some Consumer body to protect the rights of consumers, these people are getting away with what the common man would be \"brought to book\" for.Can you imagine. me getting into a contract with another party, the other party commits financially to it, then when I am to perform my end of the contract I renege. I would be sued for breach of contract. I think the same should apply to Expedia and Airlines that take people\\'s money for a trip and then change it at the last minute at a terrible financial consequence to the passenger.It is downright dishonesty.', \"Is there a zero star option? Worst customer service ever. Called  over 5 times to solve a simple name change issue, placed on hold for a total of about 10 hours, was told by numerous agents that my problem was resolved, only to be told by the next agent that nothing's been solved and there's no record of any of the assurances I was given.

However after paying for a subscription, which is now 40% more expensive that it was 3 years ago, I found the number of people that had viewed my profile actually numbered only 90.  I also found that my own favourites list had been populated with countless numbers of member profiles, some of which I hadn’t even viewed or were aware of.This suggests that match algorithms are artificially adding you to others favourite lists and vice versa as well as falsifying the number of views you’ve had on your profile.Aside from the site being suspect in its operations there are also large numbers of old profiles that are still active; one of my female friends showed me that she had deactivated her profile some months ago however it was still visible in searches.  This looks like the site is leaving profiles available to search even when they shouldn’t be visible, I can only assume in an attempt to show inaccurate numbers of active members.I would not recommend this site to anyone as it attempts to encourage you to pay for a subscription by falsifying data and statistics.

I didn\\'t want a renewal, I wanted to use the last of the set that was purchased.  I had therefore asked for a refund for this renewal and it was refused.  When you purchase a set of 10 you should be able to use all 10 without it triggering a renewal for another set of 10 automatically.  The only way for it to not trigger is to use only 9 of the set.  There is no way round this.  In the past I\\'ve asked for and received a refund but this was refused this time.  It is wrong and it is fraudulent.

So you can profile stuff about your favorite things, and your strap-line on the phone but cant see them on the PC.  Same for the persons you are viewing.I wrote my profile on my PC, but then found had to do it all over again on the phone cos it dropped so much - many times.  I wrote a strap line and it mashed up with the profile text.  I wrote Looking for friendship fun and good times\" A month later I found it truncated to:\"Looking for friendship fun and goo\".

It would be funny if I weren\\'t paying good money for this and hoping this would find me the love of my life.Worst of all - and utterly unforgivable, is that there is no \"Contact Us\" email address so you can tell them that they are sh*te.

I also found that my own favourites list had been populated with countless numbers of member profiles, some of which I hadn’t even viewed or were aware of.This suggests that match algorithms are artificially adding you to others favourite lists and vice versa as well as falsifying the number of views you’ve had on your profile.Aside from the site being suspect in its operations there are also large numbers of old profiles that are still active; one of my female friends showed me that she had deactivated her profile some months ago however it was still visible in searches.  This looks like the site is leaving profiles available to search even when they shouldn’t be visible, I can only assume in an attempt to show inaccurate numbers of active members.I would not recommend this site to anyone as it attempts to encourage you to pay for a subscription by falsifying data and statistics.

After all how many family cars can accommodate a 5 feet tall, 150pound safe?..1 week later fedex ground delivers it, Box was a little battered but seemed intact so we accepted delivery. Had to open and remove box from safe to review contents, Only to discover no key. So I have a locked cabinet I cannot open. Called Walmart customer service, guess what they won’t replace the key. Ok, I said return it. Ok they say, but it must be in a box to return it, I ask how do I do that? They say after escalating to their tier 2 sophisticated customer service, “that’s my problem, if I don’t b0x it, I cant return it”.. they cared nothing that they short shipped an order and charged me, they cared nothing that they could simply get me a key.. and they certainly cared nothing about customer service. If I couldtn’t Use something I got from them, they don’t care. It’s like about Walmart policies. .... well, I’ll cancel the credit card payment and see them in small claims court before I get stuck with a gun safe I cannot open. My advice, don’t purchase anything that requires opening from Walmart.com, because if you want to return it they make you pack it all up again for shipping. Little hard if you have to destroy the box to open it!\\n        \\n            Walmart performed like they said. They where true to their word regarding getting a warranty issue solved. A few months ago  I was moving  and hired a moving company. Once the moving was completed we started to get  our new home situated. We turned the TV on and unfortunately the screen was cracked internally. We called Walmart where I purchased the TV/warranty and they told me the steps I needed to do. Within 15 minutes I had completed the warranty paperwork and a new TV was on its way.  The TV was delivered within a week.The new TV was similar but had more features for which I was satisfied.  I would recommend Walmart to purchase any TV and also the warranty to which they back.\\n        \\n            I myself has usually had good transaction. They have some quality stuff,plenty of toys and hunting camo. Always had good dealings.\\n        \\n            Been a Walmart customer (in the store and online) for more than 12 years. I have let them know many times of recent frustrations in my local 99362 store with poor management, they never bother to respond with anything other than the corporate \"we are sorry, blah blah\". They are so huge the frustrations of one customer does not bother them. Online, they do have fast, free shipping after 39.00 but the website is clunky, slow and full of errors. Often, the descriptions are just not there or inaccurate. It is unfortunate that I live in a very rural area and have to drive 65 miles round trip, so guess I am stuck with good old WM.\\n        \\n            Poor follow up of products sold and also No Delivery!!😡Ordered iPad online. It said purchase completed, delivery will be on June 12. Today is June 13 night time. Product is still not here and I still have not got shipping confirmation. Emails to customer support since yesterday got no response!Canceled the order 👹Amazon, we love your ordering system, timely delivery and everything 🙏🏻\\n        \\n            im so upset with walmart that i dont think im gonna use their website ever again ! they have other companies between them and if you wanna send ur item back you have to deal with this 3 parties companies this is so upsetting horrible customer service !\\n        \\n            I go there just for the entertainment\\n        \\n            I have been buying online from them for many years now. The last thing I bought from them was a Mainstays Vinyl and Mesh Task Office Chair, in blue. I bought this on 6/4/2018 and I still have not received it yet. It won\\'t be delivered until 6/11/2018. They say free 2 day shipping on all orders over $35. This cost a little over $40. At least I didn\\'t have to pay shipping for this.\\n        \\n            I went to Walmart in Fremont, ca. albrea store. was there day before and got over charged,  went to store, talked to a person who seemed to be in charge, told her about overcharge, she told me to stay in line, and when I get to clerk, she would be able to help,  fu-king bi-tch disappeared just as I got to counter,  had to wait for this as-hole to come back,  then had to wait again for clerk to finish with customer she was helping,  and then the bit-ch disappeared again, clerk then tells me I have to wait again for this as-hole to again come back,  I told clerk to fu-ck off,  threw the s-hit at them and left.  THESE AS-HOLES HAVE NO CLUE AS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.   and get this,  its all over $.70 centsJUST HOW LONG DO THESE SH-T FOR BRAINS EXPECT YOU TO WAIT FOR  because some as-hole could not take the fu-king sale price down.  If they can\\'t do the job right,  THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT JOB, or learn how the job is done,  but being Walmart, fu-ked up is just plain fu-ked up and their way to fix this was to block my account\\n        \\n            Most of their products are cheaply made. As big as the stores are I couldnt even find the simplest every day things I needed. They dont stock up enough. Sometimes I have to order it online. Stay away from walmart produce and fresh food.. its full of chemicals and they taste terrible. I bought apples and other fruits there and they never rot. My dog wouldnt even eat them and he loves fruit. I do shop their but only occasionally for needed things but I avoid the place for the rest. A lot of cheap products and misleading advertising with their food.. They say its organic but its not.. organic food rots!. Other superstores are way better!\\n        \\n            Big variety of products for a good price. Grocery store to go daily!\\n        \\n            Walmart used a third party seller, the Beauty Store, to fulfill my order. It was a fake OPI, no serial number on bottom of glass, wrong font, wrong color on bottom tab, wrong number of warning images, no OPI etching on stem of brush, partially written in Spanish. FAKE BEAUTY PRODUCTS ARE DANGEROUS. You could be exposing yourself to lead or any number of toxins. And God help you if you put fake products on your face or lips. I had no idea Walmart used 3rd party sellers online. The only reason I used Walmart was because I thought Walmart would fulfill the order and it would be authentic. And it was the only place I could find the particular color I was seeking. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!\\n        \\n            Every time I try and use walmart.com it is hard to navigate and most of the things I am trying to price are not there, and says different in store or varies.\\n        \\n            The problems we are experiencing at walmart.com are due to third-party sellers and us as customer not recognizing that Walmart is the host. Third-party sellers are too comfortable underneath the Walmart umbrella, as are we. I ordered 2 video games in a deluxe version and received only Standard Version. My third party seller refused to offer the proper item saying it was not in stock and blames the confusion on Walmart. My seller offered to return my money after I paid return shipping to return the games. I expressed the situation in a chat room and the Walmart specialist who took over my escalated case went above their head, refunded my money, and told me I could keep the games. That is the Walmart I know so please don\\'t give up!\\n        \\n            It seems that Walmart has outsourced their Customer Service now and it feels like dealing with a scam company.  They are rude and don\\'t care about \"their\" customers because we are not really \"their\" customers anymore.  To Walmart: You guys are going to sink if you don\\'t get back to how you used to take care of your customers.  Amazon runs circles around you in customer service and I will shop there every time over walmart.com if the price is even remotely close.\\n        \\n            Every time I go to US, it’s a tradition to go to Wal-Mart. I love it. Varietes of food and vegetables are great, the staff are so nice and helpful.\\n        \\n            If you are smart STAY away from Walmart.com. I had ordered a hedge Trimmer for 75.00 and it was supposed to arrive Sat 6/2/18. I woke up Thursday morning 5/31/18 to track my order to see that WALMART cancelled it. So I called the Liars. I said what is up with you cancelling my order, they said it was out of stock but in stock now for 92.00 !! Sooo overnight the Liars tell me it is out of stock just so they can up the price from 75.00 to 92.00 . They are the rudest customer service reps,  they will continue  talking over you while you are talking.  They straight out lied to me. Filing a dispute on my credit card and contactING the better business Bureau.  Stay with Amazon , seriously ..walmart are rip offs.\\n        \\n            Living in a rural area doesnt give us much time to shop. Each time I have been to the stores the associate was more then helpful. At times I have used their web page and had items shipped to their store which is also a big convenience.\\n        \\n            Very quick and good communication, got a lot more than I hoped for! Really impressed to say the least, I love it.\\n        \\n            Walmart encourages you to shop online. Don\\'t. Remember how you could always take it back if it was inferior or the wrong one? Those are the old days, now you cannot return online purchases to the store and you will be at the mercy of what they call \"a trading partner\". Not my partner. I have been ignored, sent sweet email promising some action and then ignored. Never online shop here you will be stuck with what you get and no recourse.\\n        ']\n"

After all how many family cars can accommodate a 5 feet tall, 150pound safe?..1 week later fedex ground delivers it, Box was a little battered but seemed intact so we accepted delivery. Had to open and remove box from safe to review contents, Only to discover no key. So I have a locked cabinet I cannot open. Called Walmart customer service, guess what they won’t replace the key. Ok, I said return it. Ok they say, but it must be in a box to return it, I ask how do I do that? They say after escalating to their tier 2 sophisticated customer service, “that’s my problem, if I don’t b0x it, I cant return it”.. they cared nothing that they short shipped an order and charged me, they cared nothing that they could simply get me a key.. and they certainly cared nothing about customer service. If I couldtn’t Use something I got from them, they don’t care. It’s like about Walmart policies. .... well, I’ll cancel the credit card payment and see them in small claims court before I get stuck with a gun safe I cannot open. My advice, don’t purchase anything that requires opening from Walmart.com, because if you want to return it they make you pack it all up again for shipping. Little hard if you have to destroy the box to open it!', 'Walmart performed like they said. They where true to their word regarding getting a warranty issue solved.

We turned the TV on and unfortunately the screen was cracked internally. We called Walmart where I purchased the TV/warranty and they told me the steps I needed to do. Within 15 minutes I had completed the warranty paperwork and a new TV was on its way.  The TV was delivered within a week.The new TV was similar but had more features for which I was satisfied.

They are so huge the frustrations of one customer does not bother them. Online, they do have fast, free shipping after 39.00 but the website is clunky, slow and full of errors.

Stay away from walmart produce and fresh food.. its full of chemicals and they taste terrible. I bought apples and other fruits there and they never rot. My dog wouldnt even eat them and he loves fruit. I do shop their but only occasionally for needed things but I avoid the place for the rest.

My third party seller refused to offer the proper item saying it was not in stock and blames the confusion on Walmart. My seller offered to return my money after I paid return shipping to return the games. I expressed the situation in a chat room and the Walmart specialist who took over my escalated case went above their head, refunded my money, and told me I could keep the games.

Sooo overnight the Liars tell me it is out of stock just so they can up the price from 75.00 to 92.00 .

It is deceiving when you try to contact the agent about the property, and instead the website inserts some agent who calls you that is not at all connected to the property but just looking to hook up a new client. Very cheesy. In my area I much prefer HAR.com, and I only use Realtor.com when there isn't a substitute. Stop trying to throw me in with an agent I don't want. Creepy\\n        \\n            I'm a very unsatisfied customer of Realtor.com which kept my house   yearslong under false online information giving to the public. During 15 years as long I own my house  I was involved with a   r.e. agent only once through the 'For sale by owner' listing co. which had the right listing information of my house which has 4 bedrooms and not 3 which probably was given them at that time by the  Realtor.com, or the careless agent  I called them once at that time  but they never corrected the numbers and because  It was the time after the 2008/2009 crises when the r.e.prices went way down, so I refused every offer and cancelled my listing. Because I still have my health problem as reason to sell my house and thanks for our president the r.e. prices went back now I decided to  list again my house for sale. Unfortunately I wasn't enough careful  by choosing  with  listing online co. and as a bad luck I fished out an irresponsible listing company from  Miami and received  my house listing with  false, very bad information which was discovered  by an honest, good Remax agent who reported as a listing violation. After that the false information was corrected  I looked on the Realtor.com web site and has seen the false 3 bedrooms and false property size.which they kept during many years.... and    complaint  against of their false information of my house  in which I was investing a lot of money start with the automatic garage opener, new appliances etc.The Realtor.com corrected their yearslong kept false information because I didn't needed any  proof that 'I  built 1 more room' or extended my property size ..They didn't do the right job leaving my house  with a wrong estimated value even 3 r.e. agents who visited my house, the Zillow zestimate and other sources gave the proof  that my $214 K  selling price in January 2018 was right.  I learned from my mistake and bad experience. I lost forever a big junk of my trust  but I still hope, I will find a trust-fully listing agent for the sale of my beloved Spring hill 4/3/2 pool home and it is for sure I'll check double times all information but particular which listed by Realtor.com.\\n        \\n            Updated and accurate information\\n        \\n            Things popped up quickly as that’s how we set our notifications.

Creepy\", \"I'm a very unsatisfied customer of Realtor.com which kept my house   yearslong under false online information giving to the public. During 15 years as long I own my house  I was involved with a   r.e. agent only once through the 'For sale by owner' listing co. which had the right listing information of my house which has 4 bedrooms and not 3 which probably was given them at that time by the  Realtor.com, or the careless agent  I called them once at that time  but they never corrected the numbers and because  It was the time after the 2008/2009 crises when the r.e.prices went way down, so I refused every offer and cancelled my listing. Because I still have my health problem as reason to sell my house and thanks for our president the r.e. prices went back now I decided to  list again my house for sale. Unfortunately I wasn't enough careful  by choosing  with  listing online co. and as a bad luck I fished out an irresponsible listing company from  Miami and received  my house listing with  false, very bad information which was discovered  by an honest, good Remax agent who reported as a listing violation. After that the false information was corrected  I looked on the Realtor.com web site and has seen the false 3 bedrooms and false property size.which they kept during many years.... and    complaint  against of their false information of my house  in which I was investing a lot of money start with the automatic garage opener, new appliances etc.The Realtor.com corrected their yearslong kept false information because I didn't needed any  proof that 'I  built 1 more room' or extended my property size ..They didn't do the right job leaving my house  with a wrong estimated value even 3 r.e. agents who visited my house, the Zillow zestimate and other sources gave the proof  that my $214 K  selling price in January 2018 was right.  I learned from my mistake and bad experience. I lost forever a big junk of my trust  but I still hope, I will find a trust-fully listing agent for the sale of my beloved Spring hill 4/3/2 pool home and it is for sure I'll check double times all information but particular which listed by Realtor.com.\", 'Updated and accurate information', 'Things popped up quickly as that’s how we set our notifications.

I really love their original shows and movies but in the past few months the site has been overcrowded with these suck ** Bollywood movies.

Please create an option for people to create their own categories for them and just alert users as the new shows and movies come in. Thank you.|Original review: May 22, 2018Horrible programming that feels very political everything. This would be ok if it was even but it\\'s mostly liberal hate targeted towards cops, **, and straight people. They program \"dear ** people and **\" are full of hate towards ** can\\'t believe it\\'s actual shows now they bring in the largest race barker on history to develop shows lol. It\\'s the equivalent saying let\\'s have Al Sharpton produce for them it will be full of hate. I will never even watch their programs for Free America!!!|Original review: May 18, 2018In May of 2018 I discovered Netflix was fraudulently withdrawing money twice per month for 9 months and now refuse to issue a refund for eight of those months. I have to go through my bank to get my money back. There is a glitch in their system (that they appear to be aware of) when you update your personal information. Rather than update the account, a second account was created and Netflix \"saw\" similarities so they linked the two accounts and billed accordingly. I cancelled both accounts. Go Hulu and Amazon!!|Original review: May 13, 2018I was given a gift certificate by my family for a year\\'s subscription to Netflix. I am guessing Netflix raised their prices in the time it took me to subscribe as my $60 gift card wasn\\'t expected to go as far as expected when I signed up. I used Netflix for about a month without an issue. I will be without internet for an indefinite period and I wanted to put my account on hold or cancel the subscription so I could use my balance when I started with Netflix again in the future. I was told by floor manager Michael in Tampa, FL, customer service that I could not save my $50 plus balance from being reduced to nothing during the time I will be without internet, even after I canceled my subscription.I was told Netflix was unwilling to make this right by sending me a gift card for my remaining balance and there was no one else I could talk to about this. I was welcome to pay postage to send a letter to the corporate office, attention to no one in particular. This is terrible customer service, bad business, and has earned Netflix a failing grade in my mind. I will be warning family and friends, writing honest editorials, posting reviews like this one, and will not likely seek to do business with Netflix again unless this situation is speedily rectified. Netflix loses much more by stealing from their customers in the long run through bad publicity than if the company practiced good business principles.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: May 12, 2018I was hung up on 3 times and no one would tell me their name. Super shady company. I\\'m cancelling my credit card to make sure they will not charge me again. This company is the worst! Every customer service person kept laughing at me and saying they don\\'t really care about customers because they don\\'t pay very much. Horrible attitude.|Original review: May 7, 2018We\\'ve been subscribers with Netflix since almost the beginning... especially the DVD service. We\\'ve endured price increase after price increase. We\\'ve been patient and understanding about half of our choices not being available on Netflix... they are on the DVD format... just not at Netflix... that\\'s the first issue. However, what we are finding more and more often in the last year or two... which is much more frustrating... is that we now find ourselves waiting not just for weeks, but for MONTHS, for one disc in our queue. Mind you, this is something that is on DVD, that Netflix has, that they let us add to our queue... but one disc has been on \\'very long wait\\' for three months now. This happens a lot!!! A \\'very very lot\\'. What could be going on here? Except mismanagement? Bean counting... bad software? All the others discs of this tv series (and not really a terribly popular series either) are available... just one isn\\'t... just one is on \\'very long wait\\'... the one disc we want!!! Make sense to you? No, not to us either. WE don\\'t get any explanation... no consolation... nothing. We have to keep rearranging our queue to get around this one disc that is apparently being watch over and over again in Gnome, Alaska.Here\\'s suggestion number one. Have more than one or two discs for a series, for the entire country of subscribers!!! Explain to the customer, when time after time it keeps getting delayed!!! Be a good businessman and actually compensate your customer for you not being able to hold up your part of the relationship!!! Money off, or a how about just an extra disc!!! Nope, that would involve some human intervention, someone who isn\\'t answering a phone from the Philippines, and reading off of a script, then telling you they have to transfer you to the \\'DVD department\\'... then getting surfer dude on the call, who is snickering and laughing at you for being upset and criticizing Netflix. This guy sounded like he was calling from Amsterdam... you know... in one of those lounges over there!! Not kidding, right out of central casting for a stoner.He just kept telling me the DVD was in transit with other customers. I asked how it could take three months... just kept repeating himself. I asked him if he could tell me when it would be our turn... just an approximation... nope. Could he tell me how many copies of this DVD Netflix has... nope. Useless!!! Keep raising your prices... there are more and more options out there. You\\'ll go the way of your predecessors...

In summary... way too many foreign language subtitled shows to wade through and the overall quality of programming has been watered down significantly. Please put these foreign speaking shows in a separate category!!! I just want to relax with a movie and not have to read the dialogue. If I wanted to do that, I would buy a book.|Original review: May 4, 2018I canceled my DVD service as I had never used it... They continued to charge me five dollars a month. They are so quick to cancel for nonpayment but will not credit me the amount... THEY OWE ME!!!|Original review: May 4, 2018Netflix was ok but, now they have only unknown movie makers and 100% unknown actors!!! I expend hours looking for a movie!!! (Never find any movie that was on a theater)... they make a lot of money to buy good movies to offer us better selection but no... is getting worse everyday. BAD.|Original review: May 2, 2018The NEW format as of 5/1/2018 is terrible. The movie selection is not good, they push and are making all their own movies or you have to read subtitles. The break down just shows the same few movies. Just like a typical American company, you like something and they just change, change, change. I am sure they are making the selection so small to force you to watch their shows. Sounds like an NBC, ABC problem but we are paying to watch!|Original review: April 30, 2018First off I would like to extend my sympathy for anyone else going through what I\\'m goin through with Netflix or that\\'s having problems with Netflix. My story starts on Nov or October of 2017 when I was intrigued by what Netflix had to offer, saw the commercials and was especially turned on by the 30 free trial. I knew of the company prior to joining and how they started with renting DVDs which quickly put blockbuster out of business. Long story short I had an account cancel due to nonpayment once and assumed I had no account. Little did i know that someone started the account back without me knowing changed my email address so they have been Netflix and chilling with my bloody programs. If you\\'re still reading it gets better. Now fast forward to 2018 April 30th 2 phone calls later I got off the phone with one rude Mindy and one beautiful but Annoying Angela which informed me that it could be fraud because they have been billing for months. Under no circumstances did I know about this. Let me tell you brothers and sisters I felt like a ** in the 16 century. I was burn alive on the phone. Anyway thank God I am straight man with common sense, They did promise to cancel the subscription and return $13.99 of my money and suggested they blocked my credit card and I should contact my bank to pursue fraud activity. Fair or not fair. You be the judge. Cheers.\\n                    View more\\n                |Resolution response: June 9, 2018Netflix has finally fixed this bug.

I like that you can put your act on hold when you don\\'t need it active. I would recom the service to family and friends that want to try it out.|Original review: April 12, 2018Lately every time I find a movie that I want to watch it is not in English, I cannot read the subtitles fast enough and it is frustrating. Tonight, I tried 5 movies and they were ALL in a different language and there is no way to know that until you start the movie. If I am paying for this service, I should be able to have movies in the language that I speak. I am thinking about canceling my service with Netflix for this reason.|Original review: April 10, 2018They have changed the interface in a terrible way by removing the Category option from the interface. I called the Support of Netflix several times to fix this problem, because to me selecting films from a category list like Horror, Series, Thriller, etc is the most easiest and quickest way to get through the whole content. I mean the category option which shows up a good overview of about 15/20 films on the screen and in which you can scroll up and down in an easy way. In that interface, if you hit the return button, you can exit Netflix in a quick way. But it is this option they have removed from the interface.The support told me I should maybe the only one who was using this option, because nobody should use it. I can’t imagine. Because the new interface is really a big step back. It shows up only two lines with 5 films in it and you have to scroll in a horizontal way through the line strip to get an overview of the films which are covered by a topic like “best rated films”. However, it is this that is a slow way to get an overview of the content in a topic! And if you want to close Netflix, you first have to scroll in a vertical way to the strip containing the exit Netflix button, and then scroll in a horizontal way to that Exit button. Yes Netflix, really slow! Further on the Support told you can search for Series via the Search option and typing the word ‘Series’. Again, typing the word ‘Series’ is not a quicker way than click a Series link in a Category list. Also, by typing ‘Series’ with the Search option, not the whole content of Series is showing up in the list, in contrast to the link ‘Series’ in the Category list, which shows the whole content. And this interface should give a better performance? Come on. I am ready with this and will stop my Netflix account.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: April 9, 2018For anyone just getting on the movie streaming steam train, please don\\'t blow your money on Netflix. It\\'s highly overrated and not worth subscribing to let alone supporting. Why, you ask? For one, 90% of movies on Netflix are \\'Netflix Originals\\'. 90% of Netflix originals are series. Why is that important other than the fact that it\\'s very annoying and damn right wrong? Because Netflix doesn\\'t pay royalties on their own ** content. There are very very very very few movies on Netflix that are worth watching. Most are very low budget and old AF... Speaking of, any movie found under the \\'recently added to Netflix\\' list may just as well be a movie that was released in 1980. They are just so cheap it makes me nauseous. And please dont get me started on the lack of user features. \\'Match function??? It doesn\\'t WORRRRKKK!!! Why the do they not provide an IMDB or Rotten Tomato score? The ratings they show are literally based 100% entirely off movies that I watch. MYSELF. And if I dont rate the movie afterwards, how the flying ** does Netflix know whether it\\'s a 97% match? Netflix also doesnt have sub-genres. I mean really... WTF. As for the categories, most thrillers are horror movies, many action movies are comedies, and many horror movies are thrillers. Movie descriptions are also terrible and many movies do not have a trailer and fml it goes on.To summarise. Lack of good movies. Lack of good series. Lack of series uploads. Discontinuation of series without explanation. ** suggestions. ** features. Terrible movie descriptions. Terrible everything. Netflix. You have the worst movie streaming service ever. I hope you receive a swift dose of competition and thereafter, competence. You need to seriously step up your game.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: April 6, 2018It has been 2 months and I still can\\'t access the entirety of \"My List\". Called 3 times and all I get told is it is an issue they are aware of and keep checking back for a fix. 2 months with no fix for a problem is ridiculous. Talked with a supervisor and because I\\'ve still streamed even though I can\\'t access my full list they are not going to do anything in terms of compensation or elevation of the issue further (seriously their message about the problem said do not escalate further, just take customer info and log). That\\'s bad customer service right there.|Original review: April 2, 2018My issue was Netflix was taking two payments out of my bank account but I only have one account. I spoke with Netflix customer service representative Jose who confirmed that he found a duplicate account with charges of 10.99. Netflix Jose told me he was going to cancel that account and issue a refund back to my card for the last 3 months but he informed me I had been double charged from April 2016. Netflix Jose told me the second account linked to my card showed the email was invalid. When I asked could he refund me the full amount from the second account that I have been charged for Netflix Jose said basically, “On our end it only lets us issue the last 3 months. You will need to contact your financial institution to dispute the rest of the charges.” When I told him it wasn\\'t a good enough answer and Netflix are happy to take double payment and then shrug their shoulders when they are pulled up on it. I wanted a full refund and I felt it was Netflix\\'s place to sort it out. I then asked to speak to his manager and unfortunately was put on to Netflix Francis. Netflix Francis said he understood that I had an account created with the same card and that I was charged twice for that. I asked to be refunded the full amount Netflix has been taking from my account? He said the reason, why they cannot issue more than that, is because the system cannot go further than that. Once I request the dispute my bank will contact Netflix with the information and we can process the refund. I said I know that \"systems\" are run by people and people can override systems where there is a customer service issue. This is a customer service issue. I deal with customer service issues every day in work and I go out of my way to help my customers. I didn\\'t even get an apology from Netflix Jose or Netflix Francis. I told them I wasn\\'t impressed with the service. Netflix Francis replied, “We are trying to help you, Tracy, I know you were not aware of these charges until now, we have to cancel the duplicate account and we issue the refund that we were able to process, but in order to help you with the rest of the charges this has to be done by the dispute process with your bank.” This is where I got so fed up with the lack of an apology and Netflix\\'s refusal to help. I decided to tell them how I felt it should have been handled. I said, “Netflix Francis here is what I think a real apology should sound like from a customer service representative. It should go like this... \"I\\'m so sorry you\\'re having problems with Netflix, we really value your service and will do everything to help you. I\\'m so sorry you have been double charged. I don\\'t know how this has happened but I can refund you 3 months straight away. To get the rest of the money back you have been overcharged you will have to contact your bank. Here is our customer service email and I would like you to email us and let us know if this has sorted your issue out.” I told Netflix Francis that the way he had dealt with this issue has left me annoyed and now all I want to do is to cancel Netflix service altogether and let the world know how badly Netflix treat their customers.

Gypsy was cancelled only six weeks after it premiered, without even giving it a second season which has disappointed a lot of people. Meanwhile, continuing to renew so many other insane shows. If this is how they continue to treat their original series they are going to lose a lot of viewers. In addition, the number of shows and movies we have available here in Australia on Netflix is poor.|Original review: April 1, 2018For an extra 11 a month in addition to paying Xfinity high prices who Netflix now is connected to in one way or another, like Xfinity, new movie means either low budget or a movie you watched 40000000 times.

Any TV show or movie that was a box office hit, will not be found on Live stream. Some people who are on fixed or lower incomes, cannot afford the DVD only package. Therefore, you get what you pay for. There\\'s a sense of feeling treated like trash or low class. Streamers are stuck to pick over the leftovers. Any movie or TV show that made a hit will not be found in the streaming package. I don\\'t recommend streaming, at all, unless you don\\'t care.|Original review: March 29, 2018I tried to access my account and kept getting a message nothing matched my email please call customer service. I called and verified my payment through PayPal went through, using the invoice ID from my PayPal account it was discovered that someone hacked my account, changed the email which is what you use to log in, changed the password, switched my account from a 1 screen to 4 screens causing the monthly fee to be more and then switched the language from English to Spanish. Then the movies I had saved in my profile, the profile I had for my grandson and boyfriend were all gone somewhere. The only profile was someone named Selina.When the CSR (customer service rep) I was speaking to on the phone told me hacked my account I started having a few concerns, he told me not to worry. He would reset my email login and I can just reset the password. My concern was someone hacked my account and was using it. I requested to know what was the email address connected to the account now. I was told they could not give that info. He could confirm the address if I told them but he could not give that out. Even though they knew I was the one paying it, was my account, all the changes were made within the past weeks.I then asked for a supervisor. He pretty much said they could not let me know the email address my account was changed to because of a liability issue. I did ask so what you are saying someone can hack your account lock me out that is acceptable, who knows what else they may of hacked. You mean if by chance I could track down a person using that email authorities could not be notified. Actions taken in my eyes that is stealing, Netflix is protecting the hackers not a customer of 5 years. That hacker has more rights than a paying customer who they stole from... please make that sound right to me so I can understand.

WARNING, Check your credit card information on Netflix \"Update your credit or debit card\" page!!! I tried to \"update\" my information today to a different credit card. At first, the site complained that the CVV number was invalid, which of course it was not. I tried 3 times, on the 3rd time, it seemed to take it without complaint. However, I noticed something very odd. As I had always entered my first, middle initial and last name, it had taken my initial and added that to my last name! I called support to let them know of this issue and to confirm if my card was accepted. Apparently the card was accepted. When I mentioned about the last name being wrong, the guy tried to convince me that this is just a typo and that it\\'s ok. I informed him that I am a certified computer tech and work in Corporate Head Offices of a major bank and that this is NOT acceptable.The guy went into \"parrot\" mode and kept trying to convince me that this so-called typo was fine. I demanded to speak to a supervisor. He kept repeating himself saying that, \"I\\'VE EXPLAINED THIS ALL TO YOU ALREADY!\" Needless to say, this very VERY bad attitude and arguing with me when he\\'s so wrong, just angered me more. He put me on hold for over 10 minutes. He came back 2 times saying something about the supervisor will be with me in a few minutes, which would have been fine, BUT, then he started AGAIN with his BS trying to justify his arguing. I told him to just stop talking as I don\\'t want to hear him repeat the same crap over and over. I realized that there was not going to be a supervisor and that he was playing a game. GREAT SERVICE NETFLIX!!! BETTER RETRAIN YOUR \"SUPPORT\" PEOPLE before you lose a lot of customers. I won\\'t cancel my service because I do like Netflix, but I will contact the Executive board.

Only approx 40 movies are showing up out of the 200 or more that can be in a list. Called NETFLIX several times and they could care less - condescending, rude and lying about what is going on. With the interface not working properly it is very difficult to find movies in your list without doing a search for the movie. The indicator says it is in the list but it doesn\\'t appear. In addition the date for expiration no longer appears in the movie details - only on the manual list that is not working. AND they raised their prices. The last rep I talked to sent me a link via email to cancel service. They could care less about the customer and how streaming has become so difficult and annoying to use.|Original review: March 14, 2018I signed up for Netflix and the first month was supposed to be free.

Again, typing the word ‘Series’ is not a quicker way than click a Series link in a Category list.

It's highly overrated and not worth subscribing to let alone supporting. Why, you ask? For one, 90% of movies on Netflix are 'Netflix Originals'. 90% of Netflix originals are series. Why is that important other than the fact that it's very annoying and damn right wrong? Because Netflix doesn't pay royalties on their own ** content. There are very very very very few movies on Netflix that are worth watching. Most are very low budget and old AF... Speaking of, any movie found under the 'recently added to Netflix' list may just as well be a movie that was released in 1980. They are just so cheap it makes me nauseous. And please dont get me started on the lack of user features. 'Match function??? It doesn't WORRRRKKK!!! Why the do they not provide an IMDB or Rotten Tomato score? The ratings they show are literally based 100% entirely off movies that I watch. MYSELF. And if I dont rate the movie afterwards, how the flying ** does Netflix know whether it's a 97% match? Netflix also doesnt have sub-genres. I mean really... WTF. As for the categories, most thrillers are horror movies, many action movies are comedies, and many horror movies are thrillers. Movie descriptions are also terrible and many movies do not have a trailer and fml it goes on.To summarise. Lack of good movies. Lack of good series. Lack of series uploads. Discontinuation of series without explanation. ** suggestions. ** features. Terrible movie descriptions. Terrible everything. Netflix. You have the worst movie streaming service ever.

I spoke with Netflix customer service representative Jose who confirmed that he found a duplicate account with charges of 10.99. Netflix Jose told me he was going to cancel that account and issue a refund back to my card for the last 3 months but he informed me I had been double charged from April 2016. Netflix Jose told me the second account linked to my card showed the email was invalid. When I asked could he refund me the full amount from the second account that I have been charged for Netflix Jose said basically, “On our end it only lets us issue the last 3 months. You will need to contact your financial institution to dispute the rest of the charges.” When I told him it wasn\\'t a good enough answer and Netflix are happy to take double payment and then shrug their shoulders when they are pulled up on it. I wanted a full refund and I felt it was Netflix\\'s place to sort it out. I then asked to speak to his manager and unfortunately was put on to Netflix Francis. Netflix Francis said he understood that I had an account created with the same card and that I was charged twice for that. I asked to be refunded the full amount Netflix has been taking from my account? He said the reason, why they cannot issue more than that, is because the system cannot go further than that. Once I request the dispute my bank will contact Netflix with the information and we can process the refund. I said I know that \"systems\" are run by people and people can override systems where there is a customer service issue. This is a customer service issue. I deal with customer service issues every day in work and I go out of my way to help my customers. I didn\\'t even get an apology from Netflix Jose or Netflix Francis. I told them I wasn\\'t impressed with the service. Netflix Francis replied, “We are trying to help you, Tracy, I know you were not aware of these charges until now, we have to cancel the duplicate account and we issue the refund that we were able to process, but in order to help you with the rest of the charges this has to be done by the dispute process with your bank.” This is where I got so fed up with the lack of an apology and Netflix\\'s refusal to help. I decided to tell them how I felt it should have been handled. I said, “Netflix Francis here is what I think a real apology should sound like from a customer service representative. It should go like this... \"I\\'m so sorry you\\'re having problems with Netflix, we really value your service and will do everything to help you. I\\'m so sorry you have been double charged. I don\\'t know how this has happened but I can refund you 3 months straight away. To get the rest of the money back you have been overcharged you will have to contact your bank. Here is our customer service email and I would like you to email us and let us know if this has sorted your issue out.” I told Netflix Francis that the way he had dealt with this issue has left me annoyed and now all I want to do is to cancel Netflix service altogether and let the world know how badly Netflix treat their customers.

A couple of months later, an email popped up and said my booking was cancelled with a $1,000 cancellation fee! I immediately called Expedia but was put on hold for 40 minutes before I managed to talk to a customer service rep. She said the cancellation was made by Royal Caribbean, as an agent, Expedia could not recover my booking. The only way to recover my deposit was to pay for another cabin with $4,000 markup as the market price had increased. I called them again twice (and being put on hold for over 30 min) and one of the service rep told me that 2 emails reminding the payment due were sent prior to the cancellation -- which I had never received. She said she could not forward me those emails. She said her name was Trish. I was unhappy with the forfeit of my deposit, cancellation of my cruise, and not receiving those emails, so I sent 3 other emails to the customer service to verify if they did remind me. In a service industry, customers expect to be served and those reminders would have prevented the disappointment. No one could proof that the reminder emails were sent. 3 months later, I received an email from Tier II Customer Service Rep. He did not provide solution to my request but he mentioned I could send him email if I have further question. I replied to his email asking for the proof and someone else replied that the department does not service cruise lines so gave me a 1-800 number to speak to their cruise agent. I called the cruise agent and spent 30 min explaining to her my request. She told me 2 emails were sent to me as reminder prior to cancellation. She also said there was no record that I spoke to Trish before (did \"Trish\" gave me a false name??).I informed her if she could forward me those \"reminder emails\" that would at least prove that \"Trish\" told me the truth. She said she could not forward those emails nor read those emails because those were automatically generated. Later, she changed her words and said those were not reminder emails because a \"big travel agent\" like Expedia does not send reminder emails to their customers for payment due. I was furious with their lies, so I requested to speak to a manager. The manager told me that those 2 emails were reminder emails and were automatically generated, but he could not forward them to me. I explained my disappointment with the time spent trying to get things straight and unhappy with the service provided, he simply said \"Thank you for sharing with us your concern.\" They have no intention to keep their customers.

The only drawback, the flight was not direct but involved connecting flights. I thought that because of the savings it was worth the inconvenience. I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not - to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that.I immediately called Expedia and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this. And to make matters worse, after chasing Expedia for days, they offered me another connecting flight with an 8 hours waiting time between connection, without any form of compensation for my inconvenience. I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where Expedia and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare. If Expedia or Air Canada was really genuine about their concern about their customers/passengers why was I not offered one of these trips. PROFITS PLACED AHEAD OF customers...that\\'s why.They are proper \"dodgy\" people. There must be some Consumer body to protect the rights of consumers, these people are getting away with what the common man would be \"brought to book\" for. Can you imagine, me getting into a contract with another party, the other party commits financially to it, then when I am to perform my end of the contract I renege. I would be sued for breach of contract. I think the same should apply to Expedia and Airlines that take people\\'s money for a trip and then change it at the last minute at a terrible financial consequence to the passenger.

After I pushed the final button to book, the reservation came back with different dates than I needed. I called Expedia customer service right away to say the booking was wrong. They claimed there was nothing they could do unless the hotel would agree to cancel the reservation. The hotel did not have a room available on the dates I needed, and they refused to cancel the reservation. When the date came and went and I did not show up at the hotel, the hotel charged my credit card. I tried disputing the charge on my credit card, but because I did not have screenshots of every step along the way of the booking process as proof of my claim, the bank sided with the hotel and now I am stuck paying for a hotel stay that I didn\\'t (and never could use). I consider this to be a bait and switch scam by Expedia and plan to report this to some cybercrime enforcement authority. Unless Expedia is punished for this behavior it will continue. I wonder if they get a kick-back from hotel rooms that customers can\\'t use? If some law enforcement agency can\\'t do something about this practice, maybe there should be a class action lawsuit.

I had to borrow the money for the flight and had the exact amount in my bank account. I filled out all the required fields and tried to pay with my debit MasterCard. The flight could not be booked as there was an error. I tried again, multiple times. After several tries I googled the number and called customer service at 12:38 am.

I phoned the bank and was informed there was no issue with the card or payment, that they could see authorizations from Expedia being approved but for $0. And advised I try after 4 am. Curious!!!I called Expedia back and was on the phone for more than an hour before the agent told me it was the U.S. number I had called. Two people took my info and looked at my account and no one thought to tell me until an hour later? I was transferred to the Canadian site and spoke with Mohammed. Mohammed told me there was nothing that could be done to help me as I hadn\\'t called the Canadian number originally. I called the number Canadian Google gave me. He then said the price could not be honored because there was an issue with my card. I informed him again, that I had called the bank, the issue was not my card. He then said, the card had declined because the system was updating. Which seems sketchy to me, decline the card and raise the price $150.I explained to Mohammed that I had tried the purchase many times and that it didn\\'t seem ethical to decline my card and then raise the price $150. I asked to speak with a manager and got supervisor Noah. His tone left a lot to be desired when he couldn\\'t answer my questions. He then offered me a hotel voucher.

Then I will call the BBB and give them the details of this scam.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 15, 2018I\\'m writing to express my extreme disappointment in Expedia and the Blue Travel Partner Service. I booked a trip through Expedia to the Dominican Republic from 5/29 through 6/2, in the reservation it lead me to believe that the only way to get transportation from the airport to the resort and from the resort to the airport was through Blue Travel Partners. My fiance paid for the transportation cost along with our travel.When we arrived in Punta Cana a Blue travel representative gave us a card telling us to attend in information session the next day with Melissa. We attended the information session to get our departure pick-up time and Melissa inputted her cell phone number into my phone and told me to text her the day before (Friday) we were to leave (we were leaving on Saturday). I texted Melissa at 1:36 PM on Friday to get our pick-up time. I called Blue Travel at 3:31 PM to get our pick up time since Melissa never responded, I was informed that my pick up time was 11:45 am on Saturday. Melissa responded at 4::11 pm stating \"one Moments\" I never heard back from her with a pick up time.We checked out of the RIU Republica at 11:20 and was waiting in the lobby for our pick-up. We asked the RIU workers was Blue Travel there yet and they told us they had not come yet. We continued to wait as many other travelers came and went via other pickups and never saw a blue travel representative we also asked several drivers were they Blue Travel and they all stated no. As it as getting late and we were still not picked up I call Blue Travel to inquire about our pick up and Angel told to us that the driver said we were not there when he arrived, which is not true because we had been waiting since before 11:30 am to be picked up. He then told us he could not send anyone else to pick us up and we would need to get a taxi and request reimbursement from Expedia.We almost missed our flight by 10 minutes if we had no called to find out no one was coming to pick us up. It cost us $40 for a Taxi plus what we already paid Blue Travel for a service that you did not perform. I\\'m requesting that we be reimbursed for the payment we made to Blue Travel for pick up service that you did not perform, and secondly because Melissa did not do her job with getting us the information she was suppose to supply to us prior to our pick-up. This leads me to believe that there was a mix up within your company because I had to call to get information that Melissa was suppose to provide and she never responded to my text and I also called her number and only received her voicemail. I would not have used Blue Travel if I knew they were not dependable, I only used Blue Travel because Expedia said you were a partner with them and there was no other option on Expedia\\'s website. I will never use Expedia again!\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 14, 2018Visa FlexPerks Travel Rewards and Expedia = Bad Business and BAD service and attitude. Remember those miles you have to use on your credit cards? We just got stung badly. We booked 2 nights at a Homewood Suites in Clearwater, and received a confirmation. Upon arrival, we were told Homewood Suites was never notified that we were coming, and they were full. The clerk said this happens often with 3rd party vendors, like Expedia. We called the number on the confirmation print out, and Joe from Travel Rewards apologized and said he couldn’t find another room for us, but could credit back our points.The Homewood Suites clerk was very helpful. Made several calls on our behalf attempting to find a room. There was one left for $500+ for 2 nights, 15 miles away. It was after 6pm, we were tired, we accepted it and paid Holiday Inn by American Express Credit Card. We contacted the CARDMEMBER SERVICES (sic) and after several attempts were given an email address to use to further our petition. We got an official “we can’t help you” letter in the mail from FlexPerks. On Tuesday, May 8, we just got an official phone call saying there is nothing further they can do, and they would not reimburse us our for any or all of our out-of-pocket expenses. At no point did Visa FlexPerks offer us anything for the inconvenience we were put through and the extra out of pocket costs other than the multiple words “I’m sorry!”Well, we are sorry too, and this is now being posted to social media, as a warning about travel reward programs. So this will not happen to us again, whenever we book through third party whether redeeming miles or using the third party directly, we will ALWAYS contact the ultimate supplier. We will get ONLINE with the airline and check our seats immediately. We will CALL the hotel and ask them if they have us confirmed and what is THEIR confirmation number. For the record, many of the travel award cards are distributed by banks and other financial institutions. There is much legislation and regulations in place to regulate how these institutions operate their financial programs... None of legislations deals with how they run their travel awards program which regretfully explains, but does not justify, their attitude.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 13, 2018I booked with Expedia for a funeral in Maryland only to find out since my Sister in Law was born and raised in NJ the funeral will be here and not there.

(Credit card statement showed on Feb 3) Today, 9 days before departure I was trying to print my itinerary with confirmed bookings. To my dismay, the 2 e.tickets flights were both under my name. (They always check the spelling of the passenger names in phonetics.) I called customer service, they transferred my call to ‘change of name’ dept supervisor, Lanthoi, then to another.After more than 4 hrs on the phone, and after repeated instructions, I have decided to cancel 1 e.ticket but keep the other. Something told me that something may not be right again. I called customer service, again, to my dismay my outbound flight was canceled on the remaining ticket. The customer service supervisor, Christopher **, filed a case for “investigation.” In the meantime he wanted to book me on another flight and he needed my credit card details. I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to take my bp medicine. Can someone help me?

Dear Expedia, since I can\\'t get any help from your customer services, I decided to write you on Facebook and will share with my friends/family!! On Monday, June 4th, I booked a hotel room in Mississippi. I got my itinerary with choice hotel that I PICKED and 2 seconds later, got another itinerary putting me in a different HOTEL!! I immediately called Expedia and spoke to a representative that apologized and said she will put me in the right hotel. She said that I would have to pay an extra $10.00. I was fine with that. She took my card information and then charged me the full PRICE on top of the first charge!! When she was done, she then said to me \"I\\'m going to transfer you to another agent in order to get the first charge off.\" I asked her why didn\\'t she tell me that in the first place before charging my card again? She didn\\'t answer and transferred me. The second agent says to me \"It\\'s a non-refundable hotel.\" I told him that it wasn\\'t my fault, it was on Expedia for putting me in the wrong hotel. He put me on hold to call the first hotel, came back a few minutes later and said that he was able to talk to them and they will not charge my credit card. A few days later to my surprise, I was charged for BOTH hotels!!!!!!!! Also, the first hotel not only charged me, they also cancelled my reservations!!! I called Expedia back and asked them what happened. Again, I\\'m on hold while the agent spoke to the hotel. She comes back online and says \"Ma\\'am, the manager at the hotel was not authorized to return your money, sorry it\\'s non-refundable.\" What the heck is this? I can see if I made the reservations at the wrong hotel, but I didn\\'t!!! I put my trust in Expedia and Expedia made the mistake. You will see in my pictures the SAME confirmation, SAME dates, for 2 different hotels. I\\'ve used Expedia in the past to book flights, hotels, and car rentals and have NEVER been treated this way. I asked the agent if I could speak to her supervisor or if she could she give me a direct number. Her response was \"look it up on the website.\" What type of customer service is this??? Somebody needs to give me my money back!!! I\\'m at the point that I will share this with my friends/family on all of my social media and contact our local news about this. It\\'s not fair that I lost almost $200.00 on a mistake that Expedia made and not ME!!! Also, it\\'s not like I found the mistake the next day, I found it within minutes, so this should have been resolved more professionally.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 11, 2018I will not rest until I get my $1000.00 back from this organization. I have never used this company before and will use every means to highlight their inability to treat their customer with integrity and sound business practice. In the middle of trying to arrange a trip, it became clear that there would be a problem with attaining the required visa... one I obtained confirmation that this would be an issue. I have been trying to cancelled the trip and have only received $500 dollars of the $1500.00 spent with this organization. They have tried so many different means to hold on to some for these charges however, I will continue the fight until I get all my monies back. Unacceptable!!|Original review: June 8, 2018Oh yes. I\\'m living through it now. We live in Switzerland. Booked my date for hotel 18 to 19th June 2018. Put in my dates and was told to pay. Entered my credit card number. It was \"number not valid three times\". On the fourth attempt it was suddenly accepted. Confirmation came back \"your hotel has been booked for the 3-4th June.\" What??? Immediately tried to cancel, but could not. Of course, I had booked a room with no cancellation fees because I knew we were definitely going. We had booked our train tickets already 6 or 7 weeks ago. Tried to cancel straight away, but of course, could not, Tried to contact them immediately on the website, Could not. Kept getting error messages whilst trying. This site cannot be contacted? Tried to contact them and the hotel for nearly 2 weeks now, Emails everyday. Hotel said, \"take it up with Expedia\". What a joke.They have never answered, On the night that we were supposed to be at the hotel, (the 3rd June - which I did not book) they had the cheek to ask for a review at 20:30 in the evening. Well really, we would not even have slept there yet, nor had breakfast, so how could we possibly have given a review, even if we were there? The next day I received another review request. I did this time fill it in. They only had the option of smiley faces or sad faces. Nothing like scoring. I gave them 100% sad faces, and some nasty comments. Pasted my emails to them, and my comments at the end, as to why I was unhappy. Yesterday I received a message from said booked hotel, to say \"we will address this directly\" - whatever that means? Just had the sad faces on it, and comments of those, but no mention of my overall comments and emails to them. I asked them how - no reply as yet.I can\\'t really blame the hotel, as we were never there, but someone has to take the blame. I am disgusted with Expedia. I have contacted my credit card, in fact the very next morning after, and of course the money was already taken out, but they said, \"Wait a few days, keep all your emails, then contact us again.\" I have been patient, but no more. Tomorrow I will send all the info and mails to them. My hotel was for the Radisson Blu in Lucerne, Switzerland. They should really be involved too, as it\\'s their hotel, but just fobbed me off to Expedia. What bad service, I used Expedia to go the Isle of Jersey at Christmas 2017. We were so happy. But then, that was the hotel that was so nice, and not necessarily the booking agent. I gave them scores of 10\\'s all round. Now they just have smiley/sad bloody faces. What score will that get them in the end. Neither here nor there. Well they got sad ones. Do not use booking agents if you can help it. They are all crooks. The minute they have your money - well that\\'s it. Try and contact the hotel yourself for a room. But these days, it seems like everyone has to have a booking agent. Well... I hope to at least not lose my money over this erroneous booking. But they will surely blame it on me?? Like they have done to the previous people. It was your fault. I know what I would like to call them, but that would be defamatory. I thought the customer was always right? I know I did not book for that day. Good luck to everyone on this site. Excluding Expedia of course. We will know for the next time we book - DON\\'T USE THEM. Booking.com isn\\'t too bad. We booked a hotel in Montreux for 2 nights last year. We booked a quiet room. Well, we were right by the stairwell - people running up an down all night long, a baby crying night. The bed was so uncomfortable. We did not sleep a wink. In the early morning we were so tired and then thought we could have a little nap before breakfast - oh no - the cleaning maids moved in around 6:30 in the morning, shouting to each other from room to room - so no such luck. I wonder why all those people left before 6:30 for them to clean?? Well, there were lots of hikers in the hotel. Straight after breakfast we decided we would not go back and sleep the other night. Took a bit of haggling, but we were refunded for the second day, as well as the breakfast, as that was an addition. Also had to get my credit card provider involved, but in the end, when they found out about that, I did not have to go down that route.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 7, 2018I tried three times to book a flight online and I received three different times a message saying \"sorry please try again.\" NOTE... each of the three times the price went up (3 times).

We assumed this would be rectified on arrival confidently knowing we had just paid! Unfortunately this was not the case and with no evidence on the itinerary we were BANGED TO RIGHTS so to speak... Having written the experience off as some kind of mistake we regretfully booked again via Expedia a 2 night stay in Carlisle with caution questioning our ability to order breakfast! We checked, double checked and checked again that our breakfast was included and hit the pay button... only to find once again the breakfasts had disappeared? This was confirmed at the hotel where we were told and get this... “We are well aware of this. They are doing it to everyone. We have been flooded with complaints but unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it.” Have tried on numerous occasions to get a response from Expedia only to be completely ignored.

Although the agent booked the trip incorrectly (admitted) (charged for a flight instead of a vacation) Expedia would not correct the errors. When called I was hung up on. Then, on a callback to them I was placed on hold for over 59 minutes. I was next informed by another agent that there had to be two separate itineraries. Next, I had to pay again to have double beds although I requested this on the original booking. Expedia did not change the room type requested. I was then charged to have the room listed as two people per room. On 6-6-18 I still had the booking as a king size instead of a double bed. Expedia was told that their system is antiquated. They were informed Proof could be provided that other travel agencies do allow changes when errors are made by them.

As it turned out he could not make the flight, so I called plenty of time before the flight and they stated that a full refund was only available for medical reasons. So if I understand correctly, I got charged for the travel protection, I am losing $200 being charged by the airline for the cancellation and if I re-book it has to be within the year for the same itinerary?!? I could have forgone the travel protection cost and just lost the $200 from the airline cancellation. I was told that I had bought a non-refundable ticket, had I booked through the airline I could have paid $25 a person and got the refundable ticket, whereas I could make changes.

But this time, it almost became like something in a horror movie! I book a room for 4 days at the FAIRBRIDGE INN EXPRESS, in Villa Rica, GA, thru Expedia to attend my granddaughters, 2018 High School Graduation in Douglas County. When I arrive I had a little bit of difficulty spotting the hotel, for there where no signs I could see from the road. But as I drove up to what I assume should be Fairbridge Inn I drove completely around the place wondering do I really want to stay here. There was some cheesy renovations taking place. I was book so I had to go in or be charge.As I walk into the lobby, there was an old wet smell that greeted me. There were 2 females at the check in desk, one on each side of the desk and they both greeted me. The one behind the desk ask, \"May I help you?\" I responded, \"Yes I have reservations.\" I was ask my name by the one standing on same side of the counter as I were standing. I replied with my name and she immediately replied, \"Oh yes, we have your reservation and I myself check out your room and it\\'s the best one we have, you are going to like it.I proceed to check in (cutting all the small talk & telling you about my gut feelings of this place) Room 207. I drove from the lobby area to an area where I could see the room numbers on the doors. I decided to leave my luggage in the vehicle and go up and check the room out. The outside of the place really needed some make over, but I had this feeling as I swipe the key card to open the rather filthy door, I do not think I shall be please. The smell hit me first, musty, Smokey wet odor hit me in the face, far worse than the lobby. On the carpet right at the door was this stain about the size of a basketball. The linen on the double beds where filthy with stains all about them, and I did not even have to pull any of them back to see this. The room size refrigerator and microwave, look like they could have came from some junkies\\' house from the damage on the outside and no color match. I had only taken one step (stepping over the stain in the carpet) into the this dump when I notice a hole in the wall about the size of someone\\'s head. That\\'s when I immediately left and requested refund of any charges.While waiting for the manager, I witness what I have first took as a guest for she had came out a room 2 doors from where I when to check the room out with this guy fixing her stretch pants on her. But here she was speaking to the manager about the guy in the room she came out of informing the manager that the guy in the room wants to stay another night and he had given her this watch for her to take to the pawn shop to get money for the room. From the conversation I could do nothing but overhear, she works at this dump of an Inn. And the manager inform her to go see what she can get off the watch at the pawn shop.I was given a refund and I was fortunately able to get a very nice room at the Comfort Inn, a couple of buildings away from Fairbridge Inn. I am also fortunately, that my driver license did not have my credit card address on it, for I forgot to request all photocopies to be return to me. When I spoke to my daughter, she inform me that there had been a murder at the Fairbridge Inn the night before.

A couple of months later, an email popped up and said my booking was cancelled with a $1,000 cancellation fee! I immediately called Expedia but was put on hold for 40 minutes before I managed to talk to a customer service rep. She said the cancellation was made by Royal Caribbean, as an agent, Expedia could not recover my booking. The only way to recover my deposit was to pay for another cabin with $4,000 markup as the market price had increased. I called them again twice (and being put on hold for over 30 min) and one of the service rep told me that 2 emails reminding the payment due were sent prior to the cancellation -- which I had never received. She said she could not forward me those emails. She said her name was Trish. I was unhappy with the forfeit of my deposit, cancellation of my cruise, and not receiving those emails, so I sent 3 other emails to the customer service to verify if they did remind me. In a service industry, customers expect to be served and those reminders would have prevented the disappointment. No one could proof that the reminder emails were sent. 3 months later, I received an email from Tier II Customer Service Rep. He did not provide solution to my request but he mentioned I could send him email if I have further question. I replied to his email asking for the proof and someone else replied that the department does not service cruise lines so gave me a 1-800 number to speak to their cruise agent. I called the cruise agent and spent 30 min explaining to her my request. She told me 2 emails were sent to me as reminder prior to cancellation. She also said there was no record that I spoke to Trish before (did \"Trish\" gave me a false name??).I informed her if she could forward me those \"reminder emails\" that would at least prove that \"Trish\" told me the truth. She said she could not forward those emails nor read those emails because those were automatically generated. Later, she changed her words and said those were not reminder emails because a \"big travel agent\" like Expedia does not send reminder emails to their customers for payment due. I was furious with their lies, so I requested to speak to a manager. The manager told me that those 2 emails were reminder emails and were automatically generated, but he could not forward them to me.

The only drawback, the flight was not direct but involved connecting flights. I thought that because of the savings it was worth the inconvenience. I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not - to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that.I immediately called Expedia and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this. And to make matters worse, after chasing Expedia for days, they offered me another connecting flight with an 8 hours waiting time between connection, without any form of compensation for my inconvenience. I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where Expedia and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare. If Expedia or Air Canada was really genuine about their concern about their customers/passengers why was I not offered one of these trips. PROFITS PLACED AHEAD OF customers...that\\'s why.They are proper \"dodgy\" people.

I would be sued for breach of contract.

I had it all set up with the correct days for my stay. I chose to book a non-refundable hotel stay. When I pushed the button to book, it didn't show the booking dates, but just asked for booking and credit card information. After I pushed the final button to book, the reservation came back with different dates than I needed. I called Expedia customer service right away to say the booking was wrong. They claimed there was nothing they could do unless the hotel would agree to cancel the reservation. The hotel did not have a room available on the dates I needed, and they refused to cancel the reservation. When the date came and went and I did not show up at the hotel, the hotel charged my credit card. I tried disputing the charge on my credit card, but because I did not have screenshots of every step along the way of the booking process as proof of my claim, the bank sided with the hotel and now I am stuck paying for a hotel stay that I didn't (and never could use). I consider this to be a bait and switch scam by Expedia and plan to report this to some cybercrime enforcement authority. Unless Expedia is punished for this behavior it will continue. I wonder if they get a kick-back from hotel rooms that customers can't use? If some law enforcement agency can't do something about this practice, maybe there should be a class action lawsuit.

I live with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and have been gifted a healing retreat in Phoenix Arizona, I live in Toronto Canada. For the retreat I must arrive in Phoenix before noon on June 22nd, and depart after 1:00 pm on June 30th.After searching many sites I found a round trip flight on Expedia which suited the times and my budget. I had to borrow the money for the flight and had the exact amount in my bank account. I filled out all the required fields and tried to pay with my debit MasterCard. The flight could not be booked as there was an error. I tried again, multiple times. After several tries I googled the number and called customer service at 12:38 am. The gentleman I spoke with said it was likely a security issue with the card and to call the bank. I phoned the bank and was informed there was no issue with the card or payment, that they could see authorizations from Expedia being approved but for $0. And advised I try after 4 am. Curious!!!I called Expedia back and was on the phone for more than an hour before the agent told me it was the U.S. number I had called. Two people took my info and looked at my account and no one thought to tell me until an hour later? I was transferred to the Canadian site and spoke with Mohammed. Mohammed told me there was nothing that could be done to help me as I hadn\\'t called the Canadian number originally. I called the number Canadian Google gave me. He then said the price could not be honored because there was an issue with my card. I informed him again, that I had called the bank, the issue was not my card. He then said, the card had declined because the system was updating. Which seems sketchy to me, decline the card and raise the price $150.I explained to Mohammed that I had tried the purchase many times and that it didn\\'t seem ethical to decline my card and then raise the price $150. I asked to speak with a manager and got supervisor Noah. His tone left a lot to be desired when he couldn\\'t answer my questions. He then offered me a hotel voucher. I don\\'t need a hotel, nor will I in a year and that doesn\\'t help me with the $150 extra dollars to get to my trauma treatment. He then said, \"Well if you could book right now and you can\\'t book right now... And trying might put an extra hold on your card.\" I explained again that there was no hold on my card, I had called the bank. He claimed he didn\\'t say that.

My fiance paid for the transportation cost along with our travel.When we arrived in Punta Cana a Blue travel representative gave us a card telling us to attend in information session the next day with Melissa. We attended the information session to get our departure pick-up time and Melissa inputted her cell phone number into my phone and told me to text her the day before (Friday) we were to leave (we were leaving on Saturday). I texted Melissa at 1:36 PM on Friday to get our pick-up time. I called Blue Travel at 3:31 PM to get our pick up time since Melissa never responded, I was informed that my pick up time was 11:45 am on Saturday. Melissa responded at 4::11 pm stating \"one Moments\" I never heard back from her with a pick up time.We checked out of the RIU Republica at 11:20 and was waiting in the lobby for our pick-up. We asked the RIU workers was Blue Travel there yet and they told us they had not come yet.

He then told us he could not send anyone else to pick us up and we would need to get a taxi and request reimbursement from Expedia.We almost missed our flight by 10 minutes if we had no called to find out no one was coming to pick us up. It cost us $40 for a Taxi plus what we already paid Blue Travel for a service that you did not perform. I\\'m requesting that we be reimbursed for the payment we made to Blue Travel for pick up service that you did not perform, and secondly because Melissa did not do her job with getting us the information she was suppose to supply to us prior to our pick-up.

I immediately called Expedia and spoke to a representative that apologized and said she will put me in the right hotel. She said that I would have to pay an extra $10.00. I was fine with that. She took my card information and then charged me the full PRICE on top of the first charge!!

I was then charged to have the room listed as two people per room. On 6-6-18 I still had the booking as a king size instead of a double bed. Expedia was told that their system is antiquated. They were informed Proof could be provided that other travel agencies do allow changes when errors are made by them.

But this time, it almost became like something in a horror movie! I book a room for 4 days at the FAIRBRIDGE INN EXPRESS, in Villa Rica, GA, thru Expedia to attend my granddaughters, 2018 High School Graduation in Douglas County. When I arrive I had a little bit of difficulty spotting the hotel, for there where no signs I could see from the road. But as I drove up to what I assume should be Fairbridge Inn I drove completely around the place wondering do I really want to stay here. There was some cheesy renovations taking place. I was book so I had to go in or be charge.As I walk into the lobby, there was an old wet smell that greeted me. There were 2 females at the check in desk, one on each side of the desk and they both greeted me. The one behind the desk ask, \"May I help you?\" I responded, \"Yes I have reservations.\" I was ask my name by the one standing on same side of the counter as I were standing. I replied with my name and she immediately replied, \"Oh yes, we have your reservation and I myself check out your room and it\\'s the best one we have, you are going to like it.I proceed to check in (cutting all the small talk & telling you about my gut feelings of this place) Room 207. I drove from the lobby area to an area where I could see the room numbers on the doors. I decided to leave my luggage in the vehicle and go up and check the room out. The outside of the place really needed some make over, but I had this feeling as I swipe the key card to open the rather filthy door, I do not think I shall be please. The smell hit me first, musty, Smokey wet odor hit me in the face, far worse than the lobby. On the carpet right at the door was this stain about the size of a basketball. The linen on the double beds where filthy with stains all about them, and I did not even have to pull any of them back to see this. The room size refrigerator and microwave, look like they could have came from some junkies\\' house from the damage on the outside and no color match. I had only taken one step (stepping over the stain in the carpet) into the this dump when I notice a hole in the wall about the size of someone\\'s head. That\\'s when I immediately left and requested refund of any charges.While waiting for the manager, I witness what I have first took as a guest for she had came out a room 2 doors from where I when to check the room out with this guy fixing her stretch pants on her. But here she was speaking to the manager about the guy in the room she came out of informing the manager that the guy in the room wants to stay another night and he had given her this watch for her to take to the pawn shop to get money for the room. From the conversation I could do nothing but overhear, she works at this dump of an Inn. And the manager inform her to go see what she can get off the watch at the pawn shop.I was given a refund and I was fortunately able to get a very nice room at the Comfort Inn, a couple of buildings away from Fairbridge Inn. I am also fortunately, that my driver license did not have my credit card address on it, for I forgot to request all photocopies to be return to me. When I spoke to my daughter, she inform me that there had been a murder at the Fairbridge Inn the night before.

They weren\\'t real happy when I canceled immediately so I wouldn\\'t forget the auto renewal. Right off the bat there were strange profiles of young girls, between 25 and 30. Young to me. I\\'m 65. Sending me their picture with their phone number written on the photo. Now how does that get past their strict review of all photos posted. Not once have they let anything I posted go without reviewing it. So how does one slip one past the big kahuna. Unless someone in management is in cahoots with the scammers. I have had 10 to 15 young girls with phone numbers across their picture.I have had a man write to me and tell me about his best friend who so happens to live in the same town I live in. I have had women write to me or me to them. But they only write one sentence for answers on anything that I ask. And they don\\'t ever ask you any questions. I noticed that I was writing 2 or 3 paragraphs, to her one. I feel cheated and I don\\'t think 99% of these people are even real. I have complained about the emails and profiles I have received. Even told them what I thought about some on from match in partners with the scammers. They really don\\'t want to hear it. They want you to use the block user button. Problem goes away for you but does nothing for the next guy that may not be suspicions as I.With all these good looking women wanting them it may be hard to resist and could lose their life savings. Match has this algorithm set up for the email you send them. It intercepts your mail to give you answers to the keywords you have used, that way the front office doesn\\'t have to be bothered. I had pictures or screenshots of the women I am talking about. They are on my computer somewhere but I can\\'t find them. If you are thinking about dating again do use Match.com.

So what Match does is if you\\'ve subscribe in the past, in my case one year ago. If you are not currently subscribed, and you cruising profiles they have a one click purchase screen with a 6 months membership $132 already pre checked, and your credit card info. So if you click on emailing someone and you\\'re not currently subscribed the screen will pop up, whatever you do, do not click it. Hit the back key, otherwise you end up with $132 charge. Also, they did not send me an email confirming my Match subscription and the charge on my credit at time of clicking. I found out the next day by checking my bank account online.

After 1 month, I was notified my account was terminated for violation of the User Terms. I responded in shock wanting to know what I did wrong and their arrogant response was \"get a search warrant and subpoena us to court if you want to know why we canceled your account\". I did nothing wrong like use profanity, revealing photos, nor harass anyone.I know that my ex-girlfriend stalked me on Match right before I was terminated as I saw where she viewed my profile a day or two before I was termed. I believe she (a non-paying viewer) made an erroneous complaint to Match about my account as a retaliation effort since I broke up with her a month before. If so, they took her word and didn\\'t justify why they did this to me. Ironically, my POF account got deleted the next day also and I saw where she viewed my profile there also so I know why this happened.As for the money I was out, I filed a complaint with my CC company and they refunded me the two months I prepaid that MATCH refused to refund me.

It\\'s nothing but a scam!|Original review: June 10, 2018I have been on Match.com for about 4 years in and out. I have always done the 6-month subscription and still never met anyone. It is just a money-making business. They would make you pay extra for the value package and promise you that your profile will be highlighted, but it is not true. I tried each of the packages and each time I still have to pay an extra $2.99 per day (for my profile to be highlighted so many people can contact me) after I have already paid for an expensive subscription. They probably will never highlight your profile unless your subscription is about to expire just to keep you paying. The discount that they offer is not a genuine discount. It is their way of getting people to subscribe. Nothing but a scam… Do not subscribe.|Original review: June 9, 2018I want to break down my experience so far with Match.com into two basic pieces. The first part is the system itself. Like many have eluded so far, there is a constant barrage of upgrades. I decided to go for the 6 month subscription. About 1.5 months in, I\\'ve sent out hundreds of messages I\\'m not sure if the profiles are real or if they\\'re not interested. Many seem to be \"unread\". I also think it\\'s crazy that people think the perfect person is within 50 miles or whatever from their location.Anyways, the filtering is very mechanical and people are basically turned into stats. So really, if you want to try it, you pretty much have to turn off the filters in order to get as many matches as possible. Many women seem to go with the \"free option\" and so it\\'s my understanding they can\\'t reply. I didn\\'t pay extra so they can respond based on other reviewers here. I found that I was constantly bombarded with upgrade messages, it was awful. It seemed like a waste of money to me.The second part is about the people. I\\'m not a tall man - and I\\'m okay with it. IN real life, I am sociable and meet new friends. If you\\'re under 5\\'9\" then you might want to spend some money learn how to dance or something and put your self out there in the RL. All the stuff that the women put on their profile about wanting honesty, a sense of humour... someone who isn\\'t shallow, won\\'t matter if you get filtered out based on stats. Even the women that are like 5\\'0 were looking for men over 5\\'9. It was kind of insane and if you\\'re not strong on who you are, it can beat the crap out of your own confidence. I\\'m also separated, which was a negative point for many who would have rather me not be married or divorced. I managed to connect messages with one who thought I was a \"good guy\" but didn\\'t want to get involved unless I was divorced. I think the funniest reply I got after pouring my heart out was - \"Your message was well thought out and written...\" I appreciated the honesty that I got, but two replies out of so many sent? Considering many women complained about the pervs, losers, liars, or one word messages, it\\'s pretty interesting that when I\\'d write to them, I\\'d get nothing back. I\\'m okay with not being their \"type\" whatever that is - but I think it\\'s honestly kind of rude not to answer back.My hope is that when I cancel my subscription - I won\\'t get charged again! I don\\'t care about the refund issue. It sucks, but that is the way it is set up and you agree to it when you set it up. Just check your credit statement and make sure they\\'re not overcharging you or running up charges for nothing. Beyond that, the people that seem to suck just come out in droves to take advantage of those who are looking for their perfect match. Spend your money on something like a singles events club - then at least you meet them for real so that is a way better start than expending your energy on endless messages and pictures to only find out it\\'s fake or they\\'re not real.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 8, 2018I signed up on Match.com in March of 2016. Between that time and now (June 2018) I have had contact with four people: one lived in another country, two others were scammers using some kind of automated chat bot, and the other person was 20 years younger than me. The first three were within the first couple of weeks of me signing up for the site, and the last one was about a month ago. In between, nothing.If you live in a small town, don\\'t bother with Match.com. You\\'ll get the same tiny handful of \"matches\" over and over with people who haven\\'t been on the site in months and are using cut and paste one-sentence biographies; sometimes you\\'ll see the exact same bio five or six times in a row. Despite being able to specify what you\\'re looking for (and not looking for) in a match when searching, you\\'ll still get matches with people who don\\'t fit your search criteria. Examples: if you\\'re looking for non-smokers and non-drinkers you\\'ll still get matched with smokers and drinkers; look for agnostics or non-religious and you\\'ll get matched with Bible-thumpers; search for certain physiques and you\\'ll get matched with people who *don\\'t* have the physique you\\'re interested in. What\\'s the point of having a detailed way of filtering search results if you still get matched with anyone?And if you do find someone who seems like a good match, chances are they live hundreds of miles away from you. This will sound cynical, but if you see a person with an attractive profile picture on Match chances are that person is a scammer trying to swindle you out of your money and the picture was found by typing \"hot women\" (or \"hot men\") into Google image search. One person I was matched with had a picture of the actress Blake Lively on her profile. Lively is married, so she\\'s probably not using Match. Lots of attractive people have looked at my profile, but when I clicked on their profile it was gone because the person was probably a scammer who got caught and had their profile deleted. Match is full of predators who are only interested in one thing: your credit card number. And when the person is real, half the time their profile picture is of their dog or a tree. Other times the pictures are obviously years old. Or there\\'s no picture at all. Sometimes these people are escorts looking for clients.Unlike other reviewers, I didn\\'t have any problems cancelling my membership. But when you do cancel you\\'ll start getting emails from Match saying you\\'ve got a bunch of \"likes\" and \"favorites\" to try and entice you to sign up again; you can\\'t see who these people are without paying first, though. Wow, what a coincidence I started getting notifications from interested people two days after my membership expired! This happened more than once, so it\\'s obviously a ploy by Match to get you to renew your membership again. Don\\'t make the same mistake I did. Twice. Fool me once... Instead of spending money on Match.com, take that money and go to a bar or strip club. You\\'ll at least get something for your money and you might even find your perfect \"match.\" That\\'s what I should have done.

I thought surely it\\'s just a glitch, so I tried again with a different e-mail address. I was blocked before I\\'d even finished setting up my account. I thought surely it\\'s just because I\\'m not subscribed and since I couldn\\'t log in to purchase a subscription, I set up yet another account but this time subscribed up front.Same thing happened again. I can\\'t log in, can\\'t do anything. I have not violated Terms and Conditions in any way, shape or form (how would I? I can\\'t even get my profile filled out!) and yet, I received an e-mail informing me that my original account was blocked due to a violation which Match cannot disclose due to their privacy policy and the exact same e-mail to my third, subscribed e-mail address! I\\'m leaving this review on every site I can find so as few people will get taken in as possible. I\\'m also reporting them to the BBB... which apparently has been done before and Match said they would remedy the issues after getting a poor rating. What a pity it\\'s been a year and nothing has changed!\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: May 31, 2018I was on Match.com. I thought I had the perfect soulmate. But all of a sudden they would give no phone numbers to talk to the person I was trying to be friends with. Then I called the number and all it say was it was a text email. No phone number. I understand that it being a dating site but wow they got me good. Please whatever you do do not use them. They are not a good company to deal with. They deal with people’s emotions. I would suggest to really check them out. Run as fast as you can from this so called company.|Original review: May 31, 2018Match.com provided an \"offer\" to purchase a membership for 6 months and receive an additional 6 months for free if within the first 6 months no match/connection had been made. Unfortunately I didn\\'t dig deep into the Pandora\\'s box of rules and didn\\'t realize that I needed to contact 5 people a month to now qualify for the free 6 months. So bottom line, I don\\'t qualify and Match.com will not honor the agreement. Let it be known that I\\'ve sent out 46 messages within the 6 months just not the \"required\" 5 a month.

I am a Christian women, very, very conservative. My communication with other members on the site reflected my Christian values and I was taken off the site without explanation. I realize that these accounts can be hijacked and used by others in order to scam other members but if this happened, I should have at least been told by Match.com that this had happened but they would not even investigate the matter and give me some sort of explanation. I wrote to them 3 different times and each time, they replied with the same callous answer that I was taken off due to the terms and conditions of the site. This legal answer still left me feeling violated. They just plain don\\'t care.Bottom line, I am extremely disappointed with my experience on this site and I would not recommend it to anyone with breath in their body.|Original review: May 25, 2018Awful, avoid Match.com at all costs. Firstly, the site is full of fake profiles that waste your time. Every time you login you\\'re greeted by incessant pop-ups to try and make your spend (more) money to get features that should be free to users (incognito mode, profile \\'boosts\\'), your matches are arbitrarily selected it seems and based on loosest fitting criteria of profile selections. Finally, the customer service team are inept, slow, patronising and don\\'t comply with requests from customers for accounts to be deleted - given it\\'s GDPR day perhaps they should be taking this more seriously.

Steven, the agent I spoke to at Match.com customer service, assured me that it would be resolved and that I would get an email from his supervisor that would allow me to change my current password and be able to access my account again. I never got the email. I called the next day (5/17), spoke with 2 different agents and was told that they nor their supervisors could help me. They said unless I received the email from their corporate office, I no longer have access to my account or my credit card information. I cannot believe they are getting away with this!

Two of them were one time deals. The other one we went out quite a bit, then all of a sudden she flaked out on me. You will not meet the requirements for the Match guarantee thing. There are so many stipulations that you would never be able to fulfill. You have to stay active on the site the entire six months, you have to log in daily, you have to send out a minimum of so many emails to different girls (And you will find the supply of those are limited and within in the first month you have emailed them all.). Anyway you miss one thing and you don\\'t get the guarantee anymore. I\\'m never using a pay site again.

Granted I haven\\'t spent a ton of money on any one site. That\\'s not the point. The sites I\\'ve signed up for all do the same thing. They paint such a pretty picture. They post images of women of all description. I\\'ve looked at so many pictures. I have made so many attempts to contact women. Some had pictures, some didn\\'t. I\\'m not God\\'s gift to women, I grant you that. So far not one of them has contacted me after months of trying. There is no way I can have such bad luck. It is my assessment that Match.com and all the others are bogus. It\\'s a total scam. They post pictures, tell me women have tried to contact me, I send replies to the women and guess what. I have never gotten an answer, not the first time. The federal government has shut down all the personnel on such sites as Craigslist and BackPage. They need to shut down these dating sites. All they\\'re doing is bilking the public out of their money.

At the time, I was lead to believe that this was an UPFRONT payment that was to use the service for 3 months and then it`s done. I have continuously been charged every 3 months, since December 2015 at total of $71.95 US. Paypal records show they have withdrawn $863.65 US in the last 3 YEARS!! Unknown to me, their ~terms~ in small print auto-subscribe you! It`s by NO MEANS a ~one-time fee~. I called their customer service center, and the rep confirmed for me that my last recorded activity on the site was back in Oct 2015, which makes sense, since I thought I was done the 3 months (July 28th-October) and was NOT interested in returning. After that, they just kept billing me every 3 months!! He did return my last billed amount of $71.95 US, but what about the other $790 bucks??!! DO NOT SUBSCRIBE to this company under any circumstances. What kind of company puts in an auto-subscribe into a pre-billed 3 month fee?? Auto-subscribe should always be something the customer voluntarily checks himself, since you are handling someone`s financial information. In my opinion, this is a misuse of financial information for the purpose of automatically securing financial gain from people who are either not reading the super-fine print, or missing the ~so called~ terms altogether. Shame on me for not spotting this sooner and that it took this long to notice. But I use Paypal sporadically and was not checking my account enough.

At this rate, I have no idea which emails are legitimate and which ones are scams. I have called Match.com\\'s customer service numerous times to search for resolution or a refund, but they refuse to let me speak to a manager, and then usually hang up on me (and I am not being rude).

I paid for a 3 month subscription and didn\\'t even speak with one person let alone meet anyone in person. So I canceled my account (or at least I thought since I had a page showing me \"subscription canceled\") only to find out on my auto-renewal date that I only canceled the add-on feature to my account. I didn\\'t even know I had an add-on feature, nor did I know that I would have to go to two locations to cancel my account. I tried calling them to explain that I tried to cancel my subscription and it was unclear I had to hit cancel in two different locations, and they stated \"I understand your frustration but we cannot give you a full refund, we have to charge you for this month\". I literally called them within 10 hours of my card being charged and they still charged me $35 for a month of service I will never use. Complete ripoff.

It never was. They just shuffled me off. eHarmony was amazing and excellent service! I will happily go back. Burn in hell, Match.|Original review: May 3, 2018Signed up today after reviewing what little I could on the site the night before. Upon subscribing, realized that in the hours since my profile was created, the MATCH system began sending out what they call \\'YES\\' ratings on my behalf. I could not delete these ratings. I used the online \\'chat\\' customer service to get them to delete them. The person on their end instead deleted the few YES ratings I had received even though I clearly noted that I was referring to the Sent folder not the Received and that there were over a dozen of them.No recovery of that info (though I gather since this experience that the company manages to keep all our profile info even after we delete our accounts). They were not able to remove the YES ratings that their system sent out \\'on my behalf\\' nor did they own any responsibility at first trying to blame me. I must have accidentally sent these ratings out. I corrected them as I had no idea what marking YES would do (and their FAQ doesn\\'t clarify either). So as I told them, I only removed possible matches, accepting none as I previewed the night before. They then tried to get me to clean my browser history. I asked why. They didn\\'t have an explanation. In the end, they refunded my hours-old subscription and put me back into basic service status, which is useless. I have edited my profile to explain their system glitch and that I\\'ll be removing my account shortly. Least I hope I will be able to delete content.I would NOT recommend this site to ANY female friends. Oh and the first message I received did feel like a scam message. Someone in BC asking me to contact their friend in TO who had seen my profile and really liked it. Oh and they were going to delete their profile as they had found someone. A lot of BS that I ignored. The other kicker is I live in a small community and among the YES ratings that were sent out from me by MATCH include two to people that would recognize me on the street, one of whom I have heard about and would never have contacted. When he popped up in my search field, I deleted him immediately. MATCH did the opposite and sent him a YES rating from me. UGH. What a world we\\'ve created for ourselves. Three strikes and they are out. So much for online dating.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: May 1, 2018I have been on Match.com several times since 2012. While initially, it yielded some decent communication with assorted men in a reciprocating fashion, I haven\\'t found that to be the case over the past couple of years. I\\'m sure that, as Match gained popularity over the years, they built quite an impressive database of users. The problem I have found and heard from others using the site is that even after you unsubscribe, your profile remains up on their site. I have never successfully found a way to permanently remove my profile from their site. So, what does Match do with all those non-active but not removed accounts?One thing they certainly do is give the impression that there are more \"active\" members on their site than there really are. I know they were part of a class action lawsuit pertaining to fake profiles, scammers, etc. that was dismissed. And I know that in an effort to reflect legitimate members, Match has now added features where it shows if someone has read your message, and when the last time that \"someone\" was online. But how do we know that the person \"sitting behind\" the account that has recently been online is ACTUALLY the real person in the profile?My question is, does Match use inactive member accounts to actively communicate with and deceive current members? Because from what I\\'m seeing, I think they may. Besides getting frequent messages from scammers and men WAY OUTSIDE of my age range (by 20-30 years!) here\\'s something I\\'m starting frequently seeing on my account.I see a man I\\'m interested in. I see that he\\'s been online in the past hour, couple of hours, twenty-four hours, etc. (so, I assume his is not a dormant account). I write him. The next day I see that he has read my message. Then I see that he\\'s online or has been in the past several hours yet I\\'ve gotten no response. I get it, we can\\'t ALL be a match with everyone else on Match. But when I\\'ve written over a dozen men in one week and I see the exact same pattern, it starts making me wonder. And it gets me thinking...Has Match gone out and recovered/reactivated a ton of old deactivated accounts (unbeknownst to the original owner) and employed offshore people to sit around all day, logging into those accounts (to give the appearance that people are online), and read emails received from paying members (to give the impression that there is a mutual interest)? Because that\\'s what I\\'m starting to think.I\\'m not a model but am also not ugly. I\\'m 55 but have been told I look to be in my 40s. I\\'m 5\\'8\" and fit. I have 13 current photos (2 years old or less and the most current being from the present month) on my profile including clear and close up ones and full-length ones. My profile is creative and thorough. I\\'m college educated, an empty-nester, fun, outgoing, etc. -- just like lots of other people. So, are there really just DOZENS of men on Match who simply don\\'t have the manners to respond to an email with a simple, \"No thank you\"?I really think it\\'s a well-crafted scam to keep paying members interested. You see someone has read your email... you see they\\'ve been online recently... and your hopes are built up that you\\'ll get a reply. All to no avail. And then of course after I cancel my subscription (and like others have reported), I start getting all the emails from Match telling me about all the men that are interested in me, messaged me, etc. -- all in an effort to get me to rejoin.My account expires on May 5th and I will NEVER join Match.com (or other sites like them) again. It\\'s been a horrible experience (and I haven\\'t even mentioned the messages I\\'ve received from men/scammers over the past six years asking for naked photos, to be friends with benefits, wanting to just sext, requests for threesomes with their girlfriends, etc. Also, why does Match offer the opportunity to delineate what age range I am interested in when men 20-30 years older than me can still write me? I am 55 and actually received a message from an 85-year-old man whose message literally read, \"I\\'m a few years older than you...\" A few?! Ya think?! I\\'d love to hear what others think about my insinuations regarding Match.com using inactive accounts to communicate with/deceive current members.

Not once have they let anything I posted go without reviewing it. So how does one slip one past the big kahuna. Unless someone in management is in cahoots with the scammers. I have had 10 to 15 young girls with phone numbers across their picture.I have had a man write to me and tell me about his best friend who so happens to live in the same town I live in.

It's nothing but a scam!\", 'Original review: June 10, 2018I have been on Match.com for about 4 years in and out. I have always done the 6-month subscription and still never met anyone. It is just a money-making business. They would make you pay extra for the value package and promise you that your profile will be highlighted, but it is not true. I tried each of the packages and each time I still have to pay an extra $2.99 per day (for my profile to be highlighted so many people can contact me) after I have already paid for an expensive subscription. They probably will never highlight your profile unless your subscription is about to expire just to keep you paying. The discount that they offer is not a genuine discount. It is their way of getting people to subscribe. Nothing but a scam… Do not subscribe.', 'Original review: June 9, 2018I want to break down my experience so far with Match.com into two basic pieces. The first part is the system itself. Like many have eluded so far, there is a constant barrage of upgrades. I decided to go for the 6 month subscription. About 1.5 months in, I\\'ve sent out hundreds of messages I\\'m not sure if the profiles are real or if they\\'re not interested. Many seem to be \"unread\". I also think it\\'s crazy that people think the perfect person is within 50 miles or whatever from their location.Anyways, the filtering is very mechanical and people are basically turned into stats. So really, if you want to try it, you pretty much have to turn off the filters in order to get as many matches as possible. Many women seem to go with the \"free option\" and so it\\'s my understanding they can\\'t reply. I didn\\'t pay extra so they can respond based on other reviewers here. I found that I was constantly bombarded with upgrade messages, it was awful. It seemed like a waste of money to me.The second part is about the people. I\\'m not a tall man - and I\\'m okay with it. IN real life, I am sociable and meet new friends. If you\\'re under 5\\'9\" then you might want to spend some money learn how to dance or something and put your self out there in the RL. All the stuff that the women put on their profile about wanting honesty, a sense of humour... someone who isn\\'t shallow, won\\'t matter if you get filtered out based on stats. Even the women that are like 5\\'0 were looking for men over 5\\'9. It was kind of insane and if you\\'re not strong on who you are, it can beat the crap out of your own confidence. I\\'m also separated, which was a negative point for many who would have rather me not be married or divorced. I managed to connect messages with one who thought I was a \"good guy\" but didn\\'t want to get involved unless I was divorced. I think the funniest reply I got after pouring my heart out was - \"Your message was well thought out and written...\" I appreciated the honesty that I got, but two replies out of so many sent? Considering many women complained about the pervs, losers, liars, or one word messages, it\\'s pretty interesting that when I\\'d write to them, I\\'d get nothing back. I\\'m okay with not being their \"type\" whatever that is - but I think it\\'s honestly kind of rude not to answer back.My hope is that when I cancel my subscription - I won\\'t get charged again! I don\\'t care about the refund issue. It sucks, but that is the way it is set up and you agree to it when you set it up. Just check your credit statement and make sure they\\'re not overcharging you or running up charges for nothing. Beyond that, the people that seem to suck just come out in droves to take advantage of those who are looking for their perfect match. Spend your money on something like a singles events club - then at least you meet them for real so that is a way better start than expending your energy on endless messages and pictures to only find out it\\'s fake or they\\'re not real.\\n                    View more\\n                ', 'Original review: June 8, 2018I signed up on Match.com in March of 2016. Between that time and now (June 2018) I have had contact with four people: one lived in another country, two others were scammers using some kind of automated chat bot, and the other person was 20 years younger than me. The first three were within the first couple of weeks of me signing up for the site, and the last one was about a month ago. In between, nothing.If you live in a small town, don\\'t bother with Match.com. You\\'ll get the same tiny handful of \"matches\" over and over with people who haven\\'t been on the site in months and are using cut and paste one-sentence biographies; sometimes you\\'ll see the exact same bio five or six times in a row. Despite being able to specify what you\\'re looking for (and not looking for) in a match when searching, you\\'ll still get matches with people who don\\'t fit your search criteria. Examples: if you\\'re looking for non-smokers and non-drinkers you\\'ll still get matched with smokers and drinkers; look for agnostics or non-religious and you\\'ll get matched with Bible-thumpers; search for certain physiques and you\\'ll get matched with people who *don\\'t* have the physique you\\'re interested in. What\\'s the point of having a detailed way of filtering search results if you still get matched with anyone?And if you do find someone who seems like a good match, chances are they live hundreds of miles away from you. This will sound cynical, but if you see a person with an attractive profile picture on Match chances are that person is a scammer trying to swindle you out of your money and the picture was found by typing \"hot women\" (or \"hot men\") into Google image search. One person I was matched with had a picture of the actress Blake Lively on her profile. Lively is married, so she\\'s probably not using Match. Lots of attractive people have looked at my profile, but when I clicked on their profile it was gone because the person was probably a scammer who got caught and had their profile deleted. Match is full of predators who are only interested in one thing: your credit card number. And when the person is real, half the time their profile picture is of their dog or a tree. Other times the pictures are obviously years old. Or there\\'s no picture at all. Sometimes these people are escorts looking for clients.Unlike other reviewers, I didn\\'t have any problems cancelling my membership. But when you do cancel you\\'ll start getting emails from Match saying you\\'ve got a bunch of \"likes\" and \"favorites\" to try and entice you to sign up again; you can\\'t see who these people are without paying first, though. Wow, what a coincidence I started getting notifications from interested people two days after my membership expired! This happened more than once, so it\\'s obviously a ploy by Match to get you to renew your membership again. Don\\'t make the same mistake I did. Twice. Fool me once... Instead of spending money on Match.com, take that money and go to a bar or strip club.

Upon subscribing, realized that in the hours since my profile was created, the MATCH system began sending out what they call 'YES' ratings on my behalf. I could not delete these ratings. I used the online 'chat' customer service to get them to delete them. The person on their end instead deleted the few YES ratings I had received even though I clearly noted that I was referring to the Sent folder not the Received and that there were over a dozen of them.No recovery of that info (though I gather since this experience that the company manages to keep all our profile info even after we delete our accounts). They were not able to remove the YES ratings that their system sent out 'on my behalf' nor did they own any responsibility at first trying to blame me. I must have accidentally sent these ratings out. I corrected them as I had no idea what marking YES would do (and their FAQ doesn't clarify either). So as I told them, I only removed possible matches, accepting none as I previewed the night before. They then tried to get me to clean my browser history. I asked why.

The other kicker is I live in a small community and among the YES ratings that were sent out from me by MATCH include two to people that would recognize me on the street, one of whom I have heard about and would never have contacted.

While initially, it yielded some decent communication with assorted men in a reciprocating fashion, I haven\\'t found that to be the case over the past couple of years. I\\'m sure that, as Match gained popularity over the years, they built quite an impressive database of users. The problem I have found and heard from others using the site is that even after you unsubscribe, your profile remains up on their site. I have never successfully found a way to permanently remove my profile from their site. So, what does Match do with all those non-active but not removed accounts?One thing they certainly do is give the impression that there are more \"active\" members on their site than there really are. I know they were part of a class action lawsuit pertaining to fake profiles, scammers, etc. that was dismissed. And I know that in an effort to reflect legitimate members, Match has now added features where it shows if someone has read your message, and when the last time that \"someone\" was online. But how do we know that the person \"sitting behind\" the account that has recently been online is ACTUALLY the real person in the profile?My question is, does Match use inactive member accounts to actively communicate with and deceive current members? Because from what I\\'m seeing, I think they may. Besides getting frequent messages from scammers and men WAY OUTSIDE of my age range (by 20-30 years!) here\\'s something I\\'m starting frequently seeing on my account.I see a man I\\'m interested in.

But when I\\'ve written over a dozen men in one week and I see the exact same pattern, it starts making me wonder. And it gets me thinking...Has Match gone out and recovered/reactivated a ton of old deactivated accounts (unbeknownst to the original owner) and employed offshore people to sit around all day, logging into those accounts (to give the appearance that people are online), and read emails received from paying members (to give the impression that there is a mutual interest)? Because that\\'s what I\\'m starting to think.I\\'m not a model but am also not ugly. I\\'m 55 but have been told I look to be in my 40s. I\\'m 5\\'8\" and fit. I have 13 current photos (2 years old or less and the most current being from the present month) on my profile including clear and close up ones and full-length ones. My profile is creative and thorough. I\\'m college educated, an empty-nester, fun, outgoing, etc. -- just like lots of other people. So, are there really just DOZENS of men on Match who simply don\\'t have the manners to respond to an email with a simple, \"No thank you\"?I really think it\\'s a well-crafted scam to keep paying members interested. You see someone has read your email... you see they\\'ve been online recently... and your hopes are built up that you\\'ll get a reply. All to no avail. And then of course after I cancel my subscription (and like others have reported), I start getting all the emails from Match telling me about all the men that are interested in me, messaged me, etc. -- all in an effort to get me to rejoin.My account expires on May 5th and I will NEVER join Match.com (or other sites like them) again.

I am appalled at your customer services. For months you have only one cashier open for more than twelve items. Even at Christmas and Easter shopping days there are long line-ups at ONE cashier. Are you so poor that you cannot employ more cashiers? Even at the 12 or less part I have seen one person until a customer got angry and complained. Then a second came around. Don\\'t tell me they are all at a coffee break. No other Walmart store is that bad.

I got an email shortly thereafter saying my order was ready for pick-up. The Walmart website said the same. I went to the store and buzzed for attendance at the pick-up center. After 10 minutes when nobody came, I had to search the store for a manager. She told me the order wouldn’t be ready for at least a week. I called customer service and entered and confirmed the order number. The rep eventually came online and said the system didn’t have the number and I had to repeat it. I then told her what happened and asked that the order be shipped free of charge. She said the only thing she could do was cancel the order. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and after half an hour I hung up.I then used Walmart’s chat feature to try to resolve the issue. The rep agreed to my request, but said he couldn’t actually fix it. Instead he gave me an incident number and told me to call customer service. I called customer service and the agent said she could not find the incident number and could not help me. I asked to speak to a supervisor who finally agreed to ship the vitamins free of charge. I then asked to be compensated for all my time and trouble. He refused. Walmart advertises their wonderful online service and wants to compete with Amazon. If my experience is any guide, they have a lot of work to do.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 10, 2018The Walmart in Gladstone Missouri is an absolute joke.

Was there day before and got over charged, went to store, talked to a person who seemed to be in charge, told her about overcharge, she told me to stay in line, and when I get to clerk, she would be able to help, ** disappeared just as I got to counter, had to wait for this ** to come back, then had to wait again for clerk to finish with customer she was helping, and then the ** disappeared again, clerk then tells me I have to wait again for this ** to again come back, I told clerk to ** off, threw the ** at them and left. THESE ** HAVE NO CLUE AS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE. And get this, it\\'s all over $.70 cents.JUST HOW LONG DO THESE ** FOR BRAINS EXPECT YOU TO WAIT FOR because some ** could not take the ** sale price down. If they can\\'t do the job right, THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT JOB, or learn how the job is done, but being Walmart, ** up is just plain ** up.

It took just 4 days to ship my order via Canada Post. Wal-Mart gave me a Canada Post tracking # day 1. Canada Post picked up the item day 3. They delivered it the next day, which suggests that everything was local but that is only a guess. The day AFTER it arrived at the store (per tracking #) Wal-Mart sent me an e-mail that it was in transit. Item won\\'t arrive for an addition 12 days from the day it actually was delivered.Contacted (pardon the inaccurate description) Customer Service and got nothing. Tried chat. OMG. She said it was shipped via WM Logistics, which of course is simply the name of their shipping department/warehouse. She also said that there is no way that it would have been shipped Canada Post because they ship everything WM Logistics. Just for the record I had a Dyson Vacuum shipped from Wal-Mart Ontario. It was shipped Canada Post to a postal outlet. Blistering fast delivery. My point is \"Chat lady\" has little or no idea about Wal-Mart shipping and should avoid discussing it. I know to NEVER ship to a store. Use a postal outlet. Wal-Mart policy is that I have to wait 16 days for an item that they shipped to their store in 4.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 9, 2018Does Walmart train employees at all or just set them free? I’ve never been anywhere that has worse employees ever. I just called and all I wanted to know was if there was propane tanks for exchange. They have been out for the past 2 weeks. It took forever to get the answer, the call was picked up multiple times just to be transferred again. I finally got my answer but it was like a duh answer and he was so rude. I’m like really!!! How clueless is everyone in that store? They are not aware of anything, can’t multitask at all, hate dealing with customers, slow, clueless and sooo rude!!! Walmart as a whole should be humiliated with the quality of training they give their employees or the little concern on how they expect them to act and treat customers. This is why I don’t shop at Walmart!!! This is not just random either. This is every time I have shop or call any Walmart ever.|Original review: June 9, 2018Recently purchased an item online for pickup. I used a bank debit card. In the store with returns they give you cash back using a debit bank card. If you purchase online for pickup they treat all sales as credit. Holding my hard earned money hostage. If you can refund immediately in stores on debit cards, they should refund immediately with online orders. Phoned customer service at headquarters. Rude, rude, rude, rude...|Original review: June 9, 2018My family and I was in the Walmart on 6/8/2018 in Irving, TX. We used the self-checkout. I use one and my daughter, her boyfriend, and my sister used the other one. I rung up 3 bags of chocolate chips (on sale for 1.00 and 1.42) that was on sale. After ringing up the third bag, an error message pops up. The ** employee came running over. She said, \"Wait a minute, I have to put my code in (rude and nasty attitude).\" Then she said, \"Move over some I need some room.\" She proceeded to look in my bag, counting my items, looking at the screen counting the 3 things (which is understandable). She started comparing the prices like the price was going to change. She then tells me that she have to make sure. I\\'m thinking make sure of what, that I didn\\'t change the price or I didn\\'t steal a bag of chocolate chips!Next, my daughter gets a code because she is purchasing beer. Her boyfriend has rung up his items and standing by the bags waiting on her to finish. The same ** employee comes up and ask him for his ID. He refuse and we are asking why does she need to check his ID when my daughter is the one that is purchasing the beer (my daughter is 27). She says that is a Walmart rule that anyone that is with the party must show ID. Really??? She said I can get the manager over here. We all was saying that we have never heard such a thing the whole time we have been shopping at Walmart. My daughter said, \"Forget it. I don\\'t want it.\" We was going to leave it until the employee made a smart comment. So I asked for her to get the manager. JD, the customer service manager comes over. She tells him what happened and he says the same thing that she said. I asked JD when this rule took effect. He couldn\\'t answer the question.I took the beer and see that if I go to the checkout line with my family that the employee going to ask all of us for IDs\\'. He said that \"I am going to follow y‘all to every line and tell them not to sell you the beer.\" I said. \"Why would you have to follow us to every line when that is Walmart\\'s rule? They would know to ask all of us for IDs\\'.\" He said, \"Well they may all not know.\" Really JD. So the same ** employee is running her mouth. JD is not saying anything to her. We ask for the corporate office phone number and what is the ** employee name since she turned her badge around so we could not see her name. We asked the employee her name but she told the girl not to tell us. We asked JD and he said Brenda. As we were walking away, I\\'m not going to lie, my sister called Brenda a racist **, Brenda said, \"least I\\'m not a mini **.\"I heard her and my daughter boyfriend heard her. He walked back to confronted her, but he thought she said a ** mini. Brenda then started shouting at him. We didn\\'t know at the time that an undercover lost prevention was watching everything unfold. She heard Brenda but said she didn\\'t hear what she said. She immediately pulls Brenda from the area. The damage had been done. Everyone was looking. We had been asked for another manager but they including JD said he was the only manager there. But when I Brenda messed up, now they were looking for the manager Chris, then assistant manager Sal came up.We were standing back when they was explaining to Sal what had happen and what Brenda said. Sherell from lost prevention must have heard what I had heard because his face was priceless. I did not tell what I heard because I knew what my family would have done and I didn’t want it to turn any worst than it was. In my heart, I know Sherell said she didn’t hear her but I feel she did and that is why she pulled her off the floor so fast and out the door. Sherell really defuse the situation really fast. JD she be trained like Sherell is very well trained.

Returning a few items, I went to customer service line. And my husband went to get a box of face cleaner because I had the product but lost box. Had receipt for everything. I was returning. Cause I knew from past experience I would have to get it off shelf so they could scan it. He get the product and brings it to me and puts it in cart. Then goes to get pop out of machine. While he was gone lost prevention grabbed me and took me into their office. After he my husband comes looking for me, they grab him also. Reminding you I never left store. They took me to jail for shoplifting that face cleaner that was 9.97$. cause he got the wrong color than one I bought trying to return. We never took anything. We watched video. It was so embarrassing. Vent over, I\\'m sure I\\'m not only one they have done this to.|Original review: June 8, 2018This is our second memory foam mattress from WalMart. The comfort of this mattress is awesome and it wears well for the price.

The website said they would arrive on 5/31. The only reason I completed the order was because I needed them on 5/31. On 5/31 tracking showed nothing has shipped yet. Called customer service and they said, \"aww just give it another day or so\". So I received 3 items today 6/6, 2 are chair mats, the 3rd item is patio furniture. Seriously?? The 3rd floor mat is still riding around town in the FedEx truck according to their tracking and no one knows where the mysterious 4th floor mat is. So another call to customer service. While the customer service ladies were nice, their fulfillment, shipping, returning is a nightmare.|Original review: June 6, 2018If I had known that it could take 6 or more days to print 4 photos, I would NEVER have ordered online through Walmart. The agents in the store are great, but the online order didn\\'t get to them, so all I can do is wait. You could expect that online ordering for photos could take less than a day, but apparently, their IT are behind the times. Only reason I gave them one star is because I can\\'t put a red card.|Original review: June 6, 2018They must only have one customer service rep because every time I\\'ve had to call I got the same person: She has a strong accent and talks so fast it\\'s nearly impossible to understand her. She\\'s like a robot: Clearly reading from a script, not really paying attention to what you\\'re saying, and clearly she could care less about your problem.My order wasn\\'t wrapped properly and a jar of sauerkraut broke in transit (I guess) and destroyed everything else in the order (clothes etc). The box arrived at my door completely soaked in rancid-smelling sauerkraut juice, in an industrial-strength plastic bag. The whole order was ruined. Walmart customer service refused to replace my order or refund my money because they insisted on pictures even though I explained that I am on disability (very low fixed income) and so I do not have a camera or a camera phone. They didn\\'t care so I lost over $50 which is a lot of money for someone on ODSP.I ordered a laundry hamper. It was delivered without the lid. I called and got the same (the only one it seems) annoying condescending customer service rep who assured me on the Monday that the lid was being shipped immediately. She said if I hadn\\'t received it and/or email confirmation within 48 hours to call back (that\\'s when I got worried). Well, yup, you guessed it - 48 hours later still no lid and no email confirmation. I call back and guess who I got AGAIN? Yup, the SAME rep. She had no clue what I was talking about and clearly the lid hadn\\'t been dispatched so she rambled on a million miles a minute her same bull-crap... I have no idea if the lid will ever arrive.

Finally after two weeks I contacted Walmart and they said they lost it. Great customer service. They never contacted me about it and I wrote three emails about it and they never responded them and it\\'s been over a month now. Then my wife ordered a rug for our soon to be baby girl and when it came in it was damaged so we returned it and ordered another one and it was damaged too.

Within 2 months both batteries were failing to start the vehicles. Called WALMART CS about the issue. Told them the issue. Also told them that I was not wanting replacements because of the likelihood of having the same problem, and was going with a different/better brand. (Lesson learned) “All we can do is for you to bring both batteries in, and we’ll test them, and if they are bad.” (Setting the stage for the runaround) A Mechanic had already tested 1 of the batteries during reg servicing and said that the battery was bad without any input from us at all btw. I told WM Manager that I work 6-7 days per week, and very had very little free time, and that it would take some time before I could get into other place to get new Interstate batteries and get installed. I was just calling to let them know before the 90 days was up so to make sure that I could get a refund. “No problem, just bring them in as soon as you get the new batteries.” You can probably guess what happened next. The Walmart circus began. After getting the typical song and dance routine from the original store, then from Corporate. Contacted another WM store in a more reputable area of town. Told them what was happening. “No problem, just bring them on in and we’ll test them, and give you a refund.” Nope. Took them in, and Manager quoted previously hooked the batteries up about 10 different ways (obviously having no clue how to work the machine) including hooking the opposite terminals up backwards at least twice. (We’re looking at one another and just backing away from idiot and machine at this point). Then another Manager walks by and says “What are you doing! You have them hooked up backwards!” Manager #1 in a panic in a panic at this point, then gets frustrated, turns around frustrated begins flopping battery#2 back into the cart and states “The tester says these batteries are good, but I can give you a free replacement.” I said no. We had prearranged that there would be a refund. Then she takes off into the back of the store. Long story short. I called WM Corporate back again, as I was talking to Corp. looked down and saw that the contents of one of the batteries was now visible on the outside of the battery. Corp. started to start the same song and dance, then after my telling about the leaked battery contents right there in front of CS desk, they finally conceded to contact the store. For over an hour no one at the store would answer the phone while Manager basically hid in the back, obviously hoping that the problem would go away. Their final solution? Place the leaked battery in a Walmart PLASTIC BAG!!? And for us to take it home and wait for a return call that so far has never came. In order to point out the absurdity of all that had, and was continuing to take place, I asked both the WALMART store Manager, (who finally was called back out after we had to tell CS to answer the 3rd attempt from Corp to contact the store) and also asked Corporate \"Would WALMART advise an employee to place a battery that had been leaking into a Walmart plastic shopping bag and place it into a confined/living/eating area where people were in?\" (Pointing out the (POISON) warning on top of the battery.)The fact that Management had been avoiding us for hours and no one answering the phone at the store speaks for itself. I also pointed out to Corp. There was even more absurdity, but the point is made here. I considered leaving the batteries there and abandoning them, along with the over $200 spent including core charges that I would have had been losing already through this little circus, or more like a carnival scam. But out of principle, and out of the possibility to hold someone accountable, I demanded that the Manager come back out, get me the bag that was recommended, and place the now having corrosive and “poisonous” leaked material on the outside into chosen by Manager) WALMART shopping bag, so we could return home with it.EVERYONE, including some of the WALMART employees who witnessed this ridiculous incident have urged me to file suit. I have never done that in my life, but I will give them the few \"business days\" that they claimed ‘Policy’ dictates to do what is right. My recommendation: Once you give a swindler your money, there are generally only 2 ways that you are going to get it back. Avoid all of this by not giving it to them to begin with. Walmart’s tactics are becoming increasingly more deceptive, and aggressive toward/against their customers. Don’t become a victim and learn this lesson the hard way.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: June 4, 2018With the exception of one customer service rep that was curt and condescending (I should have complained as I\\'m confident that they would have corrected it) they have gone above and beyond in resolving any issues with my online orders.

They had them delivered through a strange delivery company who had a problem finding my apartment (which has never happened with any other company I\\'ve dealt with). I called Walmart.com, the person I spoke with was confused and did not make any attempt to contact the delivery company. She gave me a number and sent another pair of watches, unrequested. I called the number, it was wrong. After considerable time online, I was able to get a number that worked and hashed out the problem with the delivery company. The watches came the next day. Then, another set of watches came from FedEx. I never ordered them, never signed for them. They were left unprotected at my doorstep that anyone could access. I brought the box inside and left it sitting there to await Walmart to send someone to pick it up. After 18 days, they sent me an email saying they would charge me for the watches if I didn\\'t send them back. This was a major inconvenience, given my work and the challenges around getting to FedEx where I live. When I spoke with a rep, she said that FedEx can pick up, but that I have to print an invoice (I don\\'t own a printer), attach it to the box, call FedEx, arrange a pick-up time, give them the package, and call Walmart back with an invoice number. This is all a serious hassle and they were not helpful in the least.

I got an email shortly thereafter saying my order was ready for pick-up. The Walmart website said the same. I went to the store and buzzed for attendance at the pick-up center. After 10 minutes when nobody came, I had to search the store for a manager. She told me the order wouldn’t be ready for at least a week. I called customer service and entered and confirmed the order number. The rep eventually came online and said the system didn’t have the number and I had to repeat it. I then told her what happened and asked that the order be shipped free of charge. She said the only thing she could do was cancel the order. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and after half an hour I hung up.I then used Walmart’s chat feature to try to resolve the issue. The rep agreed to my request, but said he couldn’t actually fix it. Instead he gave me an incident number and told me to call customer service. I called customer service and the agent said she could not find the incident number and could not help me. I asked to speak to a supervisor who finally agreed to ship the vitamins free of charge. I then asked to be compensated for all my time and trouble. He refused.

I use one and my daughter, her boyfriend, and my sister used the other one. I rung up 3 bags of chocolate chips (on sale for 1.00 and 1.42) that was on sale. After ringing up the third bag, an error message pops up. The ** employee came running over. She said, \"Wait a minute, I have to put my code in (rude and nasty attitude).\" Then she said, \"Move over some I need some room.\" She proceeded to look in my bag, counting my items, looking at the screen counting the 3 things (which is understandable). She started comparing the prices like the price was going to change. She then tells me that she have to make sure. I\\'m thinking make sure of what, that I didn\\'t change the price or I didn\\'t steal a bag of chocolate chips!Next, my daughter gets a code because she is purchasing beer. Her boyfriend has rung up his items and standing by the bags waiting on her to finish. The same ** employee comes up and ask him for his ID. He refuse and we are asking why does she need to check his ID when my daughter is the one that is purchasing the beer (my daughter is 27). She says that is a Walmart rule that anyone that is with the party must show ID. Really??? She said I can get the manager over here. We all was saying that we have never heard such a thing the whole time we have been shopping at Walmart. My daughter said, \"Forget it. I don\\'t want it.\" We was going to leave it until the employee made a smart comment. So I asked for her to get the manager. JD, the customer service manager comes over. She tells him what happened and he says the same thing that she said. I asked JD when this rule took effect. He couldn\\'t answer the question.I took the beer and see that if I go to the checkout line with my family that the employee going to ask all of us for IDs\\'. He said that \"I am going to follow y‘all to every line and tell them not to sell you the beer.\" I said. \"Why would you have to follow us to every line when that is Walmart\\'s rule? They would know to ask all of us for IDs\\'.\" He said, \"Well they may all not know.\" Really JD. So the same ** employee is running her mouth. JD is not saying anything to her. We ask for the corporate office phone number and what is the ** employee name since she turned her badge around so we could not see her name. We asked the employee her name but she told the girl not to tell us. We asked JD and he said Brenda. As we were walking away, I\\'m not going to lie, my sister called Brenda a racist **, Brenda said, \"least I\\'m not a mini **.\"I heard her and my daughter boyfriend heard her. He walked back to confronted her, but he thought she said a ** mini. Brenda then started shouting at him. We didn\\'t know at the time that an undercover lost prevention was watching everything unfold. She heard Brenda but said she didn\\'t hear what she said. She immediately pulls Brenda from the area. The damage had been done. Everyone was looking. We had been asked for another manager but they including JD said he was the only manager there. But when I Brenda messed up, now they were looking for the manager Chris, then assistant manager Sal came up.We were standing back when they was explaining to Sal what had happen and what Brenda said. Sherell from lost prevention must have heard what I had heard because his face was priceless. I did not tell what I heard because I knew what my family would have done and I didn’t want it to turn any worst than it was. In my heart, I know Sherell said she didn’t hear her but I feel she did and that is why she pulled her off the floor so fast and out the door. Sherell really defuse the situation really fast.

Within 2 months both batteries were failing to start the vehicles. Called WALMART CS about the issue. Told them the issue. Also told them that I was not wanting replacements because of the likelihood of having the same problem, and was going with a different/better brand. (Lesson learned) “All we can do is for you to bring both batteries in, and we’ll test them, and if they are bad.” (Setting the stage for the runaround) A Mechanic had already tested 1 of the batteries during reg servicing and said that the battery was bad without any input from us at all btw. I told WM Manager that I work 6-7 days per week, and very had very little free time, and that it would take some time before I could get into other place to get new Interstate batteries and get installed. I was just calling to let them know before the 90 days was up so to make sure that I could get a refund. “No problem, just bring them in as soon as you get the new batteries.” You can probably guess what happened next. The Walmart circus began. After getting the typical song and dance routine from the original store, then from Corporate. Contacted another WM store in a more reputable area of town. Told them what was happening. “No problem, just bring them on in and we’ll test them, and give you a refund.” Nope. Took them in, and Manager quoted previously hooked the batteries up about 10 different ways (obviously having no clue how to work the machine) including hooking the opposite terminals up backwards at least twice. (We’re looking at one another and just backing away from idiot and machine at this point). Then another Manager walks by and says “What are you doing! You have them hooked up backwards!” Manager #1 in a panic in a panic at this point, then gets frustrated, turns around frustrated begins flopping battery#2 back into the cart and states “The tester says these batteries are good, but I can give you a free replacement.” I said no. We had prearranged that there would be a refund. Then she takes off into the back of the store. Long story short. I called WM Corporate back again, as I was talking to Corp. looked down and saw that the contents of one of the batteries was now visible on the outside of the battery. Corp. started to start the same song and dance, then after my telling about the leaked battery contents right there in front of CS desk, they finally conceded to contact the store. For over an hour no one at the store would answer the phone while Manager basically hid in the back, obviously hoping that the problem would go away. Their final solution? Place the leaked battery in a Walmart PLASTIC BAG!!? And for us to take it home and wait for a return call that so far has never came. In order to point out the absurdity of all that had, and was continuing to take place, I asked both the WALMART store Manager, (who finally was called back out after we had to tell CS to answer the 3rd attempt from Corp to contact the store) and also asked Corporate \"Would WALMART advise an employee to place a battery that had been leaking into a Walmart plastic shopping bag and place it into a confined/living/eating area where people were in?\" (Pointing out the (POISON) warning on top of the battery.)The fact that Management had been avoiding us for hours and no one answering the phone at the store speaks for itself. I also pointed out to Corp. There was even more absurdity, but the point is made here. I considered leaving the batteries there and abandoning them, along with the over $200 spent including core charges that I would have had been losing already through this little circus, or more like a carnival scam. But out of principle, and out of the possibility to hold someone accountable, I demanded that the Manager come back out, get me the bag that was recommended, and place the now having corrosive and “poisonous” leaked material on the outside into chosen by Manager) WALMART shopping bag, so we could return home with it.EVERYONE, including some of the WALMART employees who witnessed this ridiculous incident have urged me to file suit. I have never done that in my life, but I will give them the few \"business days\" that they claimed ‘Policy’ dictates to do what is right. My recommendation: Once you give a swindler your money, there are generally only 2 ways that you are going to get it back. Avoid all of this by not giving it to them to begin with.

It also gives accurate days on the market and when a price drops it is on there immediately.|Original review: March 27, 2017We had moved into our new home October 2015 and had used realtor.com to research homes within our budget in the area we were interested in moving to. I never had used that website before since we were in our old house for over 15 years. I do not think we would have found our house if it weren\\'t for that website. I liked the idea of the website always being updated, we did contact the realtor immediately and made arrangements to see the house we purchased the same day. I have recommended realtor.com to many others since we had such a great experience with them.

I found that Realtor.com was very up to date and allowed us to enter specific parameters and then go out to look at the houses we were interested in.|Original review: March 24, 2017The search function allows for many choices not available on other sites, like searching nearby areas which has distance from original search city.

If you want to buy or sell you must check out this site and see what happens for you. They give you all the details on the home that you need and never fret just contact the website or realtor and they will be right there to help you through it all. They show the home, the details, the price and everything you will need. You can search and find what is not on the site you are looking for. They are usually very good for saying it is pending, sold and still on the market for you. If pending and you want it just write your offer.|Original review: Sept. 29, 2016Everything is clearly displayed and all the information is visibly listed. The listings include descriptive pictures, property information, and contact information about the listings. There are contact numbers to reach agents for any questions you have, or if you are interested in seeing the property. Contact includes realtor\\'s photo, name, and contact phone number. This website is clean and modern. Easy to navigate. Listings are accurate and informative. Website is helpful and informative. Everything is clearly displayed. Includes property square foot and property value.|Original review: Sept. 28, 2016User friendly and very supportive. Had many options and filters to narrow your options. Had several link options outside of their website that were additionally helpful. I think this site is useful for both sellers and buyers. Loads of options and filters can be created to open up the viewing options for their properties to more buyers. The website was very thorough with options and true availability for the viewers of the website. Many useful links also offered that accompanies the sell or purchase of a home. Very thorough and up to date website reflecting properties and listings available. Also gives many filter options to narrow down most recent posts or dollar amount filters along with many other options.|Original review: Sept. 25, 2016Point and click. Everything needed and all inquiries answered without complicated navigation. All poignant information available, updated regularly. Live realtor online to assist in consumer\\'s need. Yes supportive of sellers, as well as consumers at the same time. Site maintains positive description and feedback on the sellers to ensure consumer\\'s peace of mind when strongly considering a certain home for purchase. Realtor.com definitely launched a quality site for new and old homeowners/purchasing a new home. Not too wordy, includes pertinent information in a simple description. Quality over quantity. I have no concern or complaints regarding the accuracy of this site. All information appears to be up to date, current stats and photos included. I didn\\'t have to write questions or concerns down regarding a property, everything is already provided.|Original review: Sept. 24, 2016Very descriptive information. Good pictures of the homes. Multiple realtors to choose from. I\\'ve used it several times over the years. I\\'ve never sold anything on realtor.com but I\\'m assuming the support is really good, people continue to use the website. The quality of the site can only be as good as the homes listed. The site was very accurate. The addresses and home information have always been spot on and the agents information has been correct. Never a problem.|Original review: Sept. 22, 2016It was so easy to use. Took me right where I need to go. No issues. No hard navigating right there. No problem. I love the service and I\\'d recommend them over. Very easy for selling a home. You will love how easy it is. I liked it so much you have no idea. So easy did not have to worry. Best out there I think. I have never found such a good service. There\\'s a lot but not with the standards this company has on selling. Right on what you are selling. Will give you spot on prices and quotes and you never have to worry it may be wrong. You can have ease of mind. You got a great site.|Original review: Sept. 20, 2016Easily navigated and generally has a lot of pictures. Good search tools. It seems to be unbiased and includes rental and purchase options for many properties. I have not personally used the site as a seller but it was very useful to me as a home buyer. I\\'d imagine that the ease of use is similar. It\\'s a well laid out website. I enjoy looking at homes and this site is helpful for that. I\\'d love a free house. I have found listings to be up to date and accurate. I sent a listing to my realtor and rented that home the next day. I enjoy using the site and tools.|Original review: Sept. 19, 2016It wasn\\'t too hard to find what I was looking for. I would definitely use it again. The site was easy to navigate through. I don\\'t think I would change anything about it. The site was very supportive for sellers. It was pretty easy to list what you needed and they had places to help if you was unsure on what you were doing. I\\'d say the quality of the site was really good. I didn\\'t have any issues with anything. Everything was self-explanatory and wasn\\'t hard. The listings were all current and up to date. I didn\\'t see any older ones. The newer listing always come first and older ones last. From what I could see everything was accurate.|Original review: Sept. 16, 2016The interface is slick and easy to use; I can look for homes easily just by entering my zip code and filtering the results. Although I have not found a house yet, I can search from various realtors to find what I am looking for. The website seems to be very supportive to sellers, showing the prices and making it easy to sort through the different types of houses. They want you to succeed and do well with the website; it seems easy to setup. The results that I get are easy and clear to differentiate. I can easily use it and I am not too worried about getting a bad result. The website seems to describe everything very well and it is very clear. I would not need to worry about searching a house at the wrong address or with the wrong types.|Original review: Sept. 15, 2016The site wasn\\'t very user-friendly. I kept having to refresh pages, had the site crash on me, and slow loading times. It was harder to find certain pieces of information on this website compared to other local websites or apps. I visited the website as a buyer, but had so many problems with the website and the filters, that I don\\'t imagine it would be helpful for sellers. The pictures on the website were great, but the filters would not work, so I couldn\\'t narrow down my choices. That is poor quality to me, because it is not helpful to consumers. All listings that I found were seeming to be current and up-to-date, but I couldn\\'t search for houses on a specific street name, making it very hard to find houses in specific areas and neighborhoods, which is not very accurate to me.|Original review: Sept. 14, 2016The site was easy to log into, set up my preferences and stay connected to new listings. They offered numerous inside pictures so that I actually knew whether I wanted to take the time to go see. Great service. The site was supportive towards sellers, it put their property in its best light and made a buyer eager to continue searching the site. The site was clearly defined and navigation was a breeze. The one thing I do like in realtor sites is actual video. I know it probably isn\\'t going to happen, but that would be great. As with all Realtors the way the pictures are taken is to show the property in its best light, however, various angles used and the way the final picture is presented can be misleading, but overall, this site was good.|Original review: Sept. 9, 2016Realtor.com is an easy site to use, loads quickly and offers a huge selection of home listings to view. It also offers features that are very helpful such as saving listings for future reference and filters that enable you to target specific features you are seeking. Realtor.com enables sellers to reach a wide online audience. Sellers can list their home with plenty of room for a description of the features and they have the opportunity to add a large number of photos. The site also enables shoppers to locate the home\\'s location on a map and they may easily determine other information such as school system ratings and crime data for the area.This is my \"go to\" site because it offers all the information I need. Unlike some annoying sites, you do not have to register in order to use the site. It is easy to use, provides search results fast and the homes listed usually have helpful information and quality photos. The information on the site appears to be current and accurate. I\\'ve never found inaccurate information during my use of the site. Properties are listed as active, pending contract, sold or in foreclosure. It\\'s easy to determine the status of a home that is listed on the site.\\n                    View more\\n                |Original review: Sept. 7, 2016It was super easy to search and find houses for sale in the area I was interested in looking. It had all the information I wanted and needed to find without any hassle. It was a good quality app giving you all the information you need about the properties and prices. It was quick and easy to use. Everyone would enjoy this app. Everything appeared to be up to date and there was plenty of description about the properties and pricing.|']\n"

They give you all the details on the home that you need and never fret just contact the website or realtor and they will be right there to help you through it all. They show the home, the details, the price and everything you will need. You can search and find what is not on the site you are looking for. They are usually very good for saying it is pending, sold and still on the market for you. If pending and you want it just write your offer.', \"Original review: Sept. 29, 2016Everything is clearly displayed and all the information is visibly listed. The listings include descriptive pictures, property information, and contact information about the listings. There are contact numbers to reach agents for any questions you have, or if you are interested in seeing the property. Contact includes realtor's photo, name, and contact phone number. This website is clean and modern. Easy to navigate. Listings are accurate and informative. Website is helpful and informative. Everything is clearly displayed. Includes property square foot and property value.\", 'Original review: Sept. 28, 2016User friendly and very supportive. Had many options and filters to narrow your options. Had several link options outside of their website that were additionally helpful. I think this site is useful for both sellers and buyers. Loads of options and filters can be created to open up the viewing options for their properties to more buyers. The website was very thorough with options and true availability for the viewers of the website. Many useful links also offered that accompanies the sell or purchase of a home. Very thorough and up to date website reflecting properties and listings available. Also gives many filter options to narrow down most recent posts or dollar amount filters along with many other options.', \"Original review: Sept. 25, 2016Point and click. Everything needed and all inquiries answered without complicated navigation. All poignant information available, updated regularly. Live realtor online to assist in consumer's need. Yes supportive of sellers, as well as consumers at the same time. Site maintains positive description and feedback on the sellers to ensure consumer's peace of mind when strongly considering a certain home for purchase. Realtor.com definitely launched a quality site for new and old homeowners/purchasing a new home. Not too wordy, includes pertinent information in a simple description. Quality over quantity. I have no concern or complaints regarding the accuracy of this site. All information appears to be up to date, current stats and photos included. I didn't have to write questions or concerns down regarding a property, everything is already provided.\", \"Original review: Sept. 24, 2016Very descriptive information. Good pictures of the homes. Multiple realtors to choose from. I've used it several times over the years. I've never sold anything on realtor.com but I'm assuming the support is really good, people continue to use the website. The quality of the site can only be as good as the homes listed. The site was very accurate. The addresses and home information have always been spot on and the agents information has been correct. Never a problem.\", \"Original review: Sept. 22, 2016It was so easy to use. Took me right where I need to go. No issues. No hard navigating right there. No problem. I love the service and I'd recommend them over. Very easy for selling a home. You will love how easy it is. I liked it so much you have no idea. So easy did not have to worry. Best out there I think. I have never found such a good service. There's a lot but not with the standards this company has on selling. Right on what you are selling. Will give you spot on prices and quotes and you never have to worry it may be wrong. You can have ease of mind. You got a great site.\", \"Original review: Sept. 20, 2016Easily navigated and generally has a lot of pictures. Good search tools. It seems to be unbiased and includes rental and purchase options for many properties. I have not personally used the site as a seller but it was very useful to me as a home buyer. I'd imagine that the ease of use is similar. It's a well laid out website. I enjoy looking at homes and this site is helpful for that. I'd love a free house. I have found listings to be up to date and accurate. I sent a listing to my realtor and rented that home the next day. I enjoy using the site and tools.\", \"Original review: Sept. 19, 2016It wasn't too hard to find what I was looking for. I would definitely use it again. The site was easy to navigate through. I don't think I would change anything about it. The site was very supportive for sellers. It was pretty easy to list what you needed and they had places to help if you was unsure on what you were doing. I'd say the quality of the site was really good. I didn't have any issues with anything. Everything was self-explanatory and wasn't hard. The listings were all current and up to date. I didn't see any older ones. The newer listing always come first and older ones last. From what I could see everything was accurate.\", 'Original review: Sept. 16, 2016The interface is slick and easy to use; I can look for homes easily just by entering my zip code and filtering the results. Although I have not found a house yet, I can search from various realtors to find what I am looking for. The website seems to be very supportive to sellers, showing the prices and making it easy to sort through the different types of houses. They want you to succeed and do well with the website; it seems easy to setup. The results that I get are easy and clear to differentiate. I can easily use it and I am not too worried about getting a bad result. The website seems to describe everything very well and it is very clear. I would not need to worry about searching a house at the wrong address or with the wrong types.', \"Original review: Sept. 15, 2016The site wasn't very user-friendly. I kept having to refresh pages, had the site crash on me, and slow loading times. It was harder to find certain pieces of information on this website compared to other local websites or apps. I visited the website as a buyer, but had so many problems with the website and the filters, that I don't imagine it would be helpful for sellers. The pictures on the website were great, but the filters would not work, so I couldn't narrow down my choices. That is poor quality to me, because it is not helpful to consumers. All listings that I found were seeming to be current and up-to-date, but I couldn't search for houses on a specific street name, making it very hard to find houses in specific areas and neighborhoods, which is not very accurate to me.\", \"Original review: Sept. 14, 2016The site was easy to log into, set up my preferences and stay connected to new listings. They offered numerous inside pictures so that I actually knew whether I wanted to take the time to go see. Great service. The site was supportive towards sellers, it put their property in its best light and made a buyer eager to continue searching the site. The site was clearly defined and navigation was a breeze. The one thing I do like in realtor sites is actual video. I know it probably isn't going to happen, but that would be great. As with all Realtors the way the pictures are taken is to show the property in its best light, however, various angles used and the way the final picture is presented can be misleading, but overall, this site was good.\", 'Original review: Sept. 9, 2016Realtor.com is an easy site to use, loads quickly and offers a huge selection of home listings to view. It also offers features that are very helpful such as saving listings for future reference and filters that enable you to target specific features you are seeking. Realtor.com enables sellers to reach a wide online audience. Sellers can list their home with plenty of room for a description of the features and they have the opportunity to add a large number of photos. The site also enables shoppers to locate the home\\'s location on a map and they may easily determine other information such as school system ratings and crime data for the area.This is my \"go to\" site because it offers all the information I need. Unlike some annoying sites, you do not have to register in order to use the site. It is easy to use, provides search results fast and the homes listed usually have helpful information and quality photos. The information on the site appears to be current and accurate. I\\'ve never found inaccurate information during my use of the site. Properties are listed as active, pending contract, sold or in foreclosure.

When we sent in our doctors note, someone else responded to our email stating that we needed to contact the airline about a refund, not Expedia.

I called Expedia once we returned because the hotel said they would offer us a  $450 credit.  The rest of the families booked through Costco and received the refund no problem.  When it came down to getting Expedia to call and request the refund they dropped the ball and told us they could offer us a 3 night stay at the same hotel.  I told Expedia that we were unable to take the credit.  I should add that I called 6 different times to get someone to help me but it was quite difficult to get them to actually help.  I asked them to check the other families credit with the hotel so they knew that we should also get it.

I called Expedia once we returned because the hotel said they would offer us a  $450 credit.  The rest of the families booked through Costco and received the refund no problem.  When it came down to getting Expedia to call and request the refund they dropped the ball and told us they could offer us a 3 night stay at the same hotel.  I told Expedia that we were unable to take the credit.  I should add that I called 6 different times to get someone to help me but it was quite difficult to get them to actually help.  I asked them to check the other families credit with the hotel so they knew that we should also get it.

My credit card company has better customer service than Expedia and I know they are working hard at getting this resolved.

After taking time to create a profile and being specific about the type of men I was interested in meeting based on their questionnaire and my personal preferences they were still matching me up with men that were not compatible by any means. If I said It was important for me to meet a non-smoker, they would match me up with smokers. If I said I was interested in meeting men with the same religious preferences they were matching me up at high percentages with men who were either not religious or \"other\". If I stated that I was interested in a certain age or race you get the point. Finally, I figured I would ask for the remaining of my money back seeing that they were just matching me up with ANYBODY. I asked and they refused to do so. Before canceling my membership I received a notice from them asking if I would rate their site. I thought oh yasss, boy will I love to rate their fake site! I was honest in saying, that I would not recommend this site to anyone and I explained why. Well after that they got mad and the admin staff behind the scene which sees and controls everything you say and do instantly put a stop to anyone contacting me any further. I went from meeting 4 - 6 new men every other day, in which most were never my type but ....... However, after I gave them a poor online rating meeting anyone new  immediately can to a halt and all conversation with new men contacting me was no more for weeks. When I approached them about it and told them I knew they were behind controlling who was able to contact me or not able to contact me, they, of course, denied it and the very next day there were 3 new men who reached out to me (yah right). Funny thing was the way these two men profile was worded you knew it was Match.com who sent me the fake conversation from members who didn\\'t exist. They are so full of it and that\\'s putting it very nicely. Don\\'t waste your money it\\'s really not worth the diasspoint.|']\n"

If I said I was interested in meeting men with the same religious preferences they were matching me up at high percentages with men who were either not religious or \"other\".

However, after I gave them a poor online rating meeting anyone new  immediately can to a halt and all conversation with new men contacting me was no more for weeks. When I approached them about it and told them I knew they were behind controlling who was able to contact me or not able to contact me, they, of course, denied it and the very next day there were 3 new men who reached out to me (yah right).

After 10 minutes when nobody came , I had to search the store for a manager. She told me the order wouldnt be ready for at least a week. I called customer service and entered and confirmed the order number. The rep eventually came on line and said the system didnt have the number and I had to repeat it.

I buy almost everything from there- from potted plants to paddle boards to a cool fridge too.  The only thing I don't like is sometimes I find some things cheaper on amazon, when walmart prides itself on its low prices.  So you just gotta look around to find a good deal online when you can.   Finding online shopping at my age has truly been amazing!\", 'I shop the local store, and order on-line for pick up at the store whenever possible.

Refused to work and said to call vendor directly. Never buying anything from walmart.com again.

They were each $ 8.95 which is a lot for me.  I couldn't get to a store easily as I am house bound.

I got an email shortly thereafter saying my order was ready for pick-up. The Walmart website said the same. I went to the store and buzzed for attendance at the pick-up center. After 10 minutes when nobody came , I had to search the store for a manager. She told me the order wouldnt be ready for at least a week. I called customer service and entered and confirmed the order number. The rep eventually came on line and said the system didnt have the number and I had to repeat it. I then told her what happened and asked that the order be shipped free of charge. She said the only thing she could do was cancel the order. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and after half an hour I hung up. \\r\\nI then used Walmarts chat feature to try to resolve the issue. The rep agreed to my request, but said he couldnt actually fix it. Instead he gave me an incident number and told me to call customer service. I called customer service and the agent said she could not find the incident number and could not help me. I asked to speak to a supervisor who finally agreed to ship the vitamins free of charge. I then asked to be compensated for all my time and trouble. He refused.\\r\\nWalmart advertises their wonderful online service and wants to compete with Amazon.

I recently ordered an item off their site. Not only did they have the best price, but it was shipped quickly. I also got email updates every step of the way. I also noticed they have greatly expanded the products they offer with much that is higher end, not the cheap junk they have a rep for. It seems to me that they are making a move to take over online shopping and using their heads about it. As long as they continue doing the same as I experienced they will do very well.\", 'The Wellness Store/walmart worst customer service. The product was said to have been delivered. But it never was. Numerous attempts have been made to find out what happened. NO one will contact me.

Then, it took another week to get the replacement and they refused to rush the shipping because \"we don\\'t do that.\"  To Walmart: You guys are going to sink if you don\\'t get back to how you used to take care of your customers. Amazon runs circles around you in customer service and I will shop there every time over walmart.com if the price is even remotely close.', 'Im speaking about the store on rt9 in Old bridge, Parlin area.

      "['I saw a listing for a home I was seriously considering contacted my agent, got in my car in South Florida, nearing Chattanooga only to receive a call from my agent saying a contract was already on the house even before I saw the listing. MARK PENDING ON SUCH LISTINGS!!|Let me start by saying to all the realtors that called in and complained about bogus leads and not being able to cancel, I understand your frustrations. Im no longer employed with them and I have been waiting MONTHS to write this review. This is by far the most unethical job I have ever encountered. I was told that I couldnt disclose certain policies and procedures to realtors that were spending loads of money on leads. Now I can speak freely. \\n\\nWhen you sign up for lead generation (zip codes) the Account Executives are going to fill your head up with lies because they want that sale. If they tell you that you will get 3-7 leads a month that is not true! 1 full share projects 40 leads a year. A half share is 20 in a year. \\n\\n The leads are not guaranteed. They will say they are. You are in a contract, they will say you can cancel anytime... that is not true! \\n\\nYou have a 3 day grace period, after that I guarantee you, your ability to cancel will be a nightmare! \\n\\nWhy? Because when you call customer care and you tell them you want to cancel youre going to be told youre in a contract. Youll say I didnt sign anything then they will say well I can start your cancellation request. Dont get too excited its just a nice way of saying, just because you asked doesnt mean it will happen. They will get you over to an account specialist. Which means youre going to get transferred to RETENTION thats if they can get a hold of someone over there. \\n\\nA multi billion dollar company and theres only 6 people in retention... so the likelihood of you speaking to someone is rare. Youll be told that they have 72 hours to call you back. \\n\\nMaybe youll get a call. Maybe you wont. \\n\\nYoull call back in furious. They will be empathetic and try to reach the person your case was assigned to. Youll be on hold long periods of time. I used to tell realtors that if you can spare time (which I know is rare) I can keep trying to reach them. I would be on a call for two hours trying to get a hold of them. Youll ask to speak to a manager. They cant help you. \\n\\nTheyll say we will get this escalated for you an escalation means that within 24 hours someone is supposed to call you back. Emphasis on supposed to. Remember there are only 6 people in the retention department. \\n\\nYoull try to remove your card by calling in. They wont let you. You can cancel your card on file which is a headache in itself because now you have to call all the other places that had your card number and let them know you have a new card. \\n\\nYou can call in with your credit card company. This will not help you if they cant get you transferred to retention. \\n\\nTheres no point in asking your account executive to cancel it for you. They dont have the ability and you will get the run around. Thats if you can even get a response from them. Account executives are rude and have absolutely no professionalism. Not the ones I talked to in the 4 months I worked there. Quick to take your money but after that? You are ignored. \\n\\nLead generation is a gamble. Are some people successful from it yes. Are all people? No. You will get spam leads. You will get a bunch of leads from other realtors asking you how the program works. This will count against your leads. \\n\\nAccount Executives will tell you that they will make up the bad leads. THIS IS A LIE!!!! You will very rarely get a credit. \\n\\nIf you are looking to cancel remember you only have 3 days to do so. They have shared leads that rotate between two other agents or unshared leads. Fast is shared leads. Flex is unshared. Remember that if you so desire to get zip codes. \\n\\nMy advice get a prepaid credit card and dont give them a back up card number at all. \\n\\nThe only product that I ever recommended was advantage so that your listings are protected. If you have a listing on RDC and you dont have advantage you wont get the lead. Someone else will. \\n\\nThe best feature you can use is the free dashboard on RDC. Create your profiles, add your NRDS ID numbers (if you have them) network by getting reviews and recommendations. You can utilize the dashboard by updating listing photos or adding open houses if it doesnt or didnt pull over from the MLS. \\n\\nListing issues: the resolution department can take up to 72 hours to resolve your issues. Due to the new updates on the dashboard (realsuite) there are more glitches on the site and there are a lot of issues with the MLSs that are unable to syndicate properly on the sight. Countless emails are sent to employees every day about something not working. \\n\\nThis pretty much is my tell all review about what to expect when you call in. This call center has a very high turnover rate. Higher than most. \\n\\nTheres a reason why there are class action lawsuits against them. Everything in the class action is correct. \\n\\nLastly customer care reps are very limited in what they can do. Customer care reps cant cancel. Cant make changes to your listings. You get transferred to another department for credit card updates. Customer care reps can help you with your dashboard and mapping issues and putting in cases. Please keep in mind to get an escalation on a case 72 business hours must have passed. \\n\\nI sincerely hope this helps someone and can perhaps spare you a long hold time or a phone call. \\n\\nShould you have questions Ill gladly answer.|This site manipulates data.  To the benefit of even down to one agent by falsely reporting a valuation with no data but with an agent\\'s opinion which is biased, and unprofessional, as they are not appraisers.\\n\\nWhen confronted, Realtor.com says they do not guarantee the value or they\\'ll say its not to be used for appraisal.   They\\'ll publish and lowball the number, but the buyers take it as gospel.  This gives the area agent an upper hand and can also lead to area realtors artificially controlling prices, to a buyer\\'s agent advantage.\\n\\nRealtor.com is more than happy to publish false numbers but won\\'t stand behind them.  Zillow was likewise accused by an Illinois real estate attorney of this, but the case was thrown out by a Liberal judge.\\n\\nThe end victim is the seller, and maybe the buyer in the opposite scenario.   Realtor.com is controlled by Newscorp, one of the largest media groups worldwide.\\n\\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act is at play here and this would not be the first time a group of realtors, supported by Realtor.com were cited by the Federal Govt.\\r\\nHowever the federal govt SHOULD do a complete review of Realtor.com practices and how this ties into the National Ass\\'n of Realtors.\\r\\nWho by the way, is one of the biggest lobby groups in Congress.\\r\\nOne hand washes the other.|Realtor.com is a scam. They not only list properties and sell leads. If your agent list your property on their site they actually will post your taxes on property 50% higher or more than the actual documented tax bill. Falsely rating the cost to buy monthly to the Consumer. Fortunately I caught it..not my agent ..and I will be exposing this fraud. My tax bill is 3400.00 per year. They post it to the site at 6000.00.\\r\\nThey are not ethical. And it is an actual federal law. To mislead through advertising when there is available legal documentation proving actual costs, that contradicts your deceptive claims, that serves to control values of the market is NOT LEGAL.|Not only have the leads been a waste of time, the majority of them looking to rent rather than buy, when I have tried to cancel my subscription realtor.com keeps changing the end date of the subscription and then sends me an email every month asking if I want to continue, I always reply NO, and they still charge my credit card.  I finally had to get my credit card to refund the most recent charges and block realtor.com for the next 15 months.\\n\\nI\\'ve sent countless emails to the account rep who signed me up and left him voicemail messages which have never been returned.  \\n\\nDoes anyone know how I can join the Class Action suit?|I have been with Realtor.com for over 3 years.  They send me all junk leads and the same ones over and over again.  I call and ask them who do you send the nice houses to.  They tell me it\\'s random and everybody gets a turn.

The problem is they have me over a barrel - I don\\'t know where else I can get leads.

We signed up for rental of our former Dahlonega home early in 2017, after losing several months due to one of their agents having an accident of which we were never informed until those vital months were lost.  We never got the full monthly rental amount  we were told to expect, which seemed to be used to lure our business -- and then dropped. CRE-CPM pressed us to rent to college students and others whom we felt would be undependable as to paying rent properly and caring for our house.  Finally, they found a father-son team to whom we agreed to rent; but when the father died suddenly, CRE-CPM absolutely refused to re-write the lease to include only the son, which was likely an invalid lease causing our tenant to believe he could just stop paying rent -- which is just what he did, costing us thousands of dollars while he remained in our house. Meanwhile, their monthly rental statements were often in error.\\n\\nThen, our CRE-CPM rental agent told us to evict him -- but she also told our tenant he was being evicted, which we had never authorized her to do, causing him to send us nasty emails claiming to justify his non-payment of rent. Then, our rental agent told us to cancel the eviction, which we did after paying for it -- but the damage was done. Our tenant stopped paying any rent at all, and CRE-CPM\\'S feeble efforts to collect it helped lead to his damaging our home and its contents (we had rented it furnished.)  Meanwhile, CRE-CPM broke our property management agreement by doing a repair at double the allowed cost for unapproved repairs -- while not bothering to check if the former work was under warranty. Our original CRE-CPM rental agent was removed by the firm\\'s owner around then.\\n\\n After our tenant left, apparently taking some of our items, the owner of CRE-CPM claimed he had supervised the tenant\\'s move -- but it turned out he had not even noted items which were missing or damaged, per our complete set of photos of our home prior to tenancy, photos in CRE-CPM\\'s possession. Finally, when we asked that same owner to honor the balance of our property management agreement by re-renting the house, as he promised to do: no serious effort was ever made, not even a FOR RENT sign at the property, and no showings or advertisements or open-houses.  When we complained about CRE-CPM\\'s failure to honor the balance of our property management agreement, that same owner immediately got a lawyer who threatened us if we took any legal action.  So, we lost thousands more rent dollars due to the firm owner\\'s failure to make a promised serious effort to re-rent our property.\\n\\nFinally, in desperation, we decided to sell our  property, rather than risk another such horrendous rental experience.\\r\\n{This is merely a summary of our own personal experience with CRE-CPM; make your own decision, but do beware!}|My husband and I have bought and sold close to 20 homes in our life time.

      "['I saw a listing for a home I was seriously considering contacted my agent, got in my car in South Florida, nearing Chattanooga only to receive a call from my agent saying a contract was already on the house even before I saw the listing. MARK PENDING ON SUCH LISTINGS!!', 'Let me start by saying to all the realtors that called in and complained about bogus leads and not being able to cancel, I understand your frustrations. Im no longer employed with them and I have been waiting MONTHS to write this review. This is by far the most unethical job I have ever encountered. I was told that I couldnt disclose certain policies and procedures to realtors that were spending loads of money on leads. Now I can speak freely. \\n\\nWhen you sign up for lead generation (zip codes) the Account Executives are going to fill your head up with lies because they want that sale. If they tell you that you will get 3-7 leads a month that is not true! 1 full share projects 40 leads a year. A half share is 20 in a year. \\n\\n The leads are not guaranteed. They will say they are. You are in a contract, they will say you can cancel anytime... that is not true! \\n\\nYou have a 3 day grace period, after that I guarantee you, your ability to cancel will be a nightmare! \\n\\nWhy? Because when you call customer care and you tell them you want to cancel youre going to be told youre in a contract. Youll say I didnt sign anything then they will say well I can start your cancellation request. Dont get too excited its just a nice way of saying, just because you asked doesnt mean it will happen. They will get you over to an account specialist. Which means youre going to get transferred to RETENTION thats if they can get a hold of someone over there. \\n\\nA multi billion dollar company and theres only 6 people in retention... so the likelihood of you speaking to someone is rare. Youll be told that they have 72 hours to call you back. \\n\\nMaybe youll get a call. Maybe you wont. \\n\\nYoull call back in furious. They will be empathetic and try to reach the person your case was assigned to. Youll be on hold long periods of time. I used to tell realtors that if you can spare time (which I know is rare) I can keep trying to reach them. I would be on a call for two hours trying to get a hold of them. Youll ask to speak to a manager. They cant help you. \\n\\nTheyll say we will get this escalated for you an escalation means that within 24 hours someone is supposed to call you back. Emphasis on supposed to. Remember there are only 6 people in the retention department. \\n\\nYoull try to remove your card by calling in. They wont let you. You can cancel your card on file which is a headache in itself because now you have to call all the other places that had your card number and let them know you have a new card. \\n\\nYou can call in with your credit card company. This will not help you if they cant get you transferred to retention. \\n\\nTheres no point in asking your account executive to cancel it for you. They dont have the ability and you will get the run around. Thats if you can even get a response from them. Account executives are rude and have absolutely no professionalism. Not the ones I talked to in the 4 months I worked there. Quick to take your money but after that? You are ignored. \\n\\nLead generation is a gamble. Are some people successful from it yes. Are all people? No. You will get spam leads. You will get a bunch of leads from other realtors asking you how the program works. This will count against your leads. \\n\\nAccount Executives will tell you that they will make up the bad leads. THIS IS A LIE!!!! You will very rarely get a credit. \\n\\nIf you are looking to cancel remember you only have 3 days to do so. They have shared leads that rotate between two other agents or unshared leads. Fast is shared leads. Flex is unshared. Remember that if you so desire to get zip codes. \\n\\nMy advice get a prepaid credit card and dont give them a back up card number at all. \\n\\nThe only product that I ever recommended was advantage so that your listings are protected. If you have a listing on RDC and you dont have advantage you wont get the lead. Someone else will. \\n\\nThe best feature you can use is the free dashboard on RDC. Create your profiles, add your NRDS ID numbers (if you have them) network by getting reviews and recommendations. You can utilize the dashboard by updating listing photos or adding open houses if it doesnt or didnt pull over from the MLS. \\n\\nListing issues: the resolution department can take up to 72 hours to resolve your issues. Due to the new updates on the dashboard (realsuite) there are more glitches on the site and there are a lot of issues with the MLSs that are unable to syndicate properly on the sight. Countless emails are sent to employees every day about something not working. \\n\\nThis pretty much is my tell all review about what to expect when you call in. This call center has a very high turnover rate. Higher than most. \\n\\nTheres a reason why there are class action lawsuits against them. Everything in the class action is correct. \\n\\nLastly customer care reps are very limited in what they can do. Customer care reps cant cancel. Cant make changes to your listings. You get transferred to another department for credit card updates. Customer care reps can help you with your dashboard and mapping issues and putting in cases. Please keep in mind to get an escalation on a case 72 business hours must have passed. \\n\\nI sincerely hope this helps someone and can perhaps spare you a long hold time or a phone call. \\n\\nShould you have questions Ill gladly answer.', \"This site manipulates data.  To the benefit of even down to one agent by falsely reporting a valuation with no data but with an agent's opinion which is biased, and unprofessional, as they are not appraisers.\\n\\nWhen confronted, Realtor.com says they do not guarantee the value or they'll say its not to be used for appraisal.   They'll publish and lowball the number, but the buyers take it as gospel.  This gives the area agent an upper hand and can also lead to area realtors artificially controlling prices, to a buyer's agent advantage.\\n\\nRealtor.com is more than happy to publish false numbers but won't stand behind them.  Zillow was likewise accused by an Illinois real estate attorney of this, but the case was thrown out by a Liberal judge.\\n\\nThe end victim is the seller, and maybe the buyer in the opposite scenario.   Realtor.com is controlled by Newscorp, one of the largest media groups worldwide.\\n\\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act is at play here and this would not be the first time a group of realtors, supported by Realtor.com were cited by the Federal Govt.\\r\\nHowever the federal govt SHOULD do a complete review of Realtor.com practices and how this ties into the National Ass'n of Realtors.\\r\\nWho by the way, is one of the biggest lobby groups in Congress.\\r\\nOne hand washes the other.\", 'Realtor.com is a scam.

They post it to the site at 6000.00.\\r\\nThey are not ethical. And it is an actual federal law.

Again, typing the word ‘Series’ is not a quicker way than click a Series link in a Category list.

I immediately called  but was put on hold for 40 minutes before I managed to talk to a customer service rep. She said the cancellation was made by Royal Caribbean, as an agent,  could not recover my booking. The only way to recover my deposit was to pay for another cabin with $4,000 markup as the market price had increased. I called them again twice (and being put on hold for over 30 min) and one of the service rep told me that 2 emails reminding the payment due were sent prior to the cancellation -- which I had never received. She said she could not forward me those emails. She said her name was Trish. I was unhappy with the forfeit of my deposit, cancellation of my cruise, and not receiving those emails, so I sent 3 other emails to the customer service to verify if they did remind me. In a service industry, customers expect to be served and those reminders would have prevented the disappointment. No one could proof that the reminder emails were sent. 3 months later, I received an email from Tier II Customer Service Rep. He did not provide solution to my request but he mentioned I could send him email if I have further question. I replied to his email asking for the proof and someone else replied that the department does not service cruise lines so gave me a 1-800 number to speak to their cruise agent. I called the cruise agent and spent 30 min explaining to her my request. She told me 2 emails were sent to me as reminder prior to cancellation. She also said there was no record that I spoke to Trish before (did \"Trish\" gave me a false name??).I informed her if she could forward me those \"reminder emails\" that would at least prove that \"Trish\" told me the truth. She said she could not forward those emails nor read those emails because those were automatically generated. Later, she changed her words and said those were not reminder emails because a \"big travel agent\" like  does not send reminder emails to their customers for payment due. I was furious with their lies, so I requested to speak to a manager. The manager told me that those 2 emails were reminder emails and were automatically generated, but he could not forward them to me.

I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not - to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that.I immediately called  and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this.

I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where  and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare.

When the date came and went and I did not show up at the hotel, the hotel charged my credit card. I tried disputing the charge on my credit card, but because I did not have screenshots of every step along the way of the booking process as proof of my claim, the bank sided with the hotel and now I am stuck paying for a hotel stay that I didn't (and never could use).

He then said the price could not be honored because there was an issue with my card. I informed him again, that I had called the bank, the issue was not my card. He then said, the card had declined because the system was updating.

But this time, it almost became like something in a horror movie!

When I arrive I had a little bit of difficulty spotting the hotel, for there where no signs I could see from the road. But as I drove up to what I assume should be Fairbridge Inn I drove completely around the place wondering do I really want to stay here. There was some cheesy renovations taking place. I was book so I had to go in or be charge.As I walk into the lobby, there was an old wet smell that greeted me. There were 2 females at the check in desk, one on each side of the desk and they both greeted me.

I replied with my name and she immediately replied, \"Oh yes, we have your reservation and I myself check out your room and it\\'s the best one we have, you are going to like it.I proceed to check in (cutting all the small talk & telling you about my gut feelings of this place) Room 207. I drove from the lobby area to an area where I could see the room numbers on the doors. I decided to leave my luggage in the vehicle and go up and check the room out. The outside of the place really needed some make over, but I had this feeling as I swipe the key card to open the rather filthy door, I do not think I shall be please. The smell hit me first, musty, Smokey wet odor hit me in the face, far worse than the lobby. On the carpet right at the door was this stain about the size of a basketball. The linen on the double beds where filthy with stains all about them, and I did not even have to pull any of them back to see this. The room size refrigerator and microwave, look like they could have came from some junkies\\' house from the damage on the outside and no color match. I had only taken one step (stepping over the stain in the carpet) into the this dump when I notice a hole in the wall about the size of someone\\'s head.

But here she was speaking to the manager about the guy in the room she came out of informing the manager that the guy in the room wants to stay another night and he had given her this watch for her to take to the pawn shop to get money for the room. From the conversation I could do nothing but overhear, she works at this dump of an Inn. And the manager inform her to go see what she can get off the watch at the pawn shop.I was given a refund and I was fortunately able to get a very nice room at the Comfort Inn, a couple of buildings away from Fairbridge Inn. I am also fortunately, that my driver license did not have my credit card address on it, for I forgot to request all photocopies to be return to me.

The first part is the system itself. Like many have eluded so far, there is a constant barrage of upgrades. I decided to go for the 6 month subscription. About 1.5 months in, I\\'ve sent out hundreds of messages I\\'m not sure if the profiles are real or if they\\'re not interested. Many seem to be \"unread\". I also think it\\'s crazy that people think the perfect person is within 50 miles or whatever from their location.Anyways, the filtering is very mechanical and people are basically turned into stats. So really, if you want to try it, you pretty much have to turn off the filters in order to get as many es as possible. Many women seem to go with the \"free option\" and so it\\'s my understanding they can\\'t reply. I didn\\'t pay extra so they can respond based on other reviewers here. I found that I was constantly bombarded with upgrade messages, it was awful. It seemed like a waste of money to me.The second part is about the people. I\\'m not a tall man - and I\\'m okay with it. IN real life, I am sociable and meet new friends. If you\\'re under 5\\'9\" then you might want to spend some money learn how to dance or something and put your self out there in the RL. All the stuff that the women put on their profile about wanting honesty, a sense of humour... someone who isn\\'t shallow, won\\'t matter if you get filtered out based on stats. Even the women that are like 5\\'0 were looking for men over 5\\'9. It was kind of insane and if you\\'re not strong on who you are, it can beat the crap out of your own confidence. I\\'m also separated, which was a negative point for many who would have rather me not be married or divorced. I managed to connect messages with one who thought I was a \"good guy\" but didn\\'t want to get involved unless I was divorced. I think the funniest reply I got after pouring my heart out was - \"Your message was well thought out and written...\" I appreciated the honesty that I got, but two replies out of so many sent? Considering many women complained about the pervs, losers, liars, or one word messages, it\\'s pretty interesting that when I\\'d write to them, I\\'d get nothing back. I\\'m okay with not being their \"type\" whatever that is - but I think it\\'s honestly kind of rude not to answer back.My hope is that when I cancel my subscription - I won\\'t get charged again!

I wrote to them 3 different times and each time, they replied with the same callous answer that I was taken off due to the terms and conditions of the site. This legal answer still left me feeling violated. They just plain don't care.Bottom line, I am extremely disappointed with my experience on this site and I would not recommend it to anyone with breath in their body.\", \"Original review: May 25, 2018Awful, avoid .com at all costs. Firstly, the site is full of fake profiles that waste your time. Every time you login you're greeted by incessant pop-ups to try and make your spend (more) money to get features that should be free to users (incognito mode, profile 'boosts'), your es are arbitrarily selected it seems and based on loosest fitting criteria of profile selections. Finally, the customer service team are inept, slow, patronising and don't comply with requests from customers for accounts to be deleted - given it's GDPR day perhaps they should be taking this more seriously.

There are so many stipulations that you would never be able to fulfill.

They post images of women of all description. I've looked at so many pictures. I have made so many attempts to contact women. Some had pictures, some didn't. I'm not God's gift to women, I grant you that. So far not one of them has contacted me after months of trying. There is no way I can have such bad luck. It is my assessment that .com and all the others are bogus. It's a total scam. They post pictures, tell me women have tried to contact me, I send replies to the women and guess what. I have never gotten an answer, not the first time. The federal government has shut down all the personnel on such sites as Craigslist and BackPage. They need to shut down these dating sites.

After that, they just kept billing me every 3 months!! He did return my last billed amount of $71.95 US, but what about the other $790 bucks??!! DO NOT SUBSCRIBE to this company under any circumstances. What kind of company puts in an auto-subscribe into a pre-billed 3 month fee?? Auto-subscribe should always be something the customer voluntarily checks himself, since you are handling someone`s financial information. In my opinion, this is a misuse of financial information for the purpose of automatically securing financial gain from people who are either not reading the super-fine print, or missing the ~so called~ terms altogether. Shame on me for not spotting this sooner and that it took this long to notice. But I use Paypal sporadically and was not checking my account enough.

Upon subscribing, realized that in the hours since my profile was created, the MATCH system began sending out what they call 'YES' ratings on my behalf. I could not delete these ratings. I used the online 'chat' customer service to get them to delete them. The person on their end instead deleted the few YES ratings I had received even though I clearly noted that I was referring to the Sent folder not the Received and that there were over a dozen of them.No recovery of that info (though I gather since this experience that the company manages to keep all our profile info even after we delete our accounts). They were not able to remove the YES ratings that their system sent out 'on my behalf' nor did they own any responsibility at first trying to blame me. I must have accidentally sent these ratings out. I corrected them as I had no idea what marking YES would do (and their FAQ doesn't clarify either). So as I told them, I only removed possible es, accepting none as I previewed the night before. They then tried to get me to clean my browser history. I asked why. They didn't have an explanation. In the end, they refunded my hours-old subscription and put me back into basic service status, which is useless. I have edited my profile to explain their system glitch and that I'll be removing my account shortly. Least I hope I will be able to delete content.I would NOT recommend this site to ANY female friends. Oh and the first message I received did feel like a scam message. Someone in BC asking me to contact their friend in TO who had seen my profile and really liked it. Oh and they were going to delete their profile as they had found someone. A lot of BS that I ignored. The other kicker is I live in a small community and among the YES ratings that were sent out from me by MATCH include two to people that would recognize me on the street, one of whom I have heard about and would never have contacted. When he popped up in my search field, I deleted him immediately. MATCH did the opposite and sent him a YES rating from me. UGH. What a world we've created for ourselves.

While initially, it yielded some decent communication with assorted men in a reciprocating fashion, I haven\\'t found that to be the case over the past couple of years. I\\'m sure that, as  gained popularity over the years, they built quite an impressive database of users. The problem I have found and heard from others using the site is that even after you unsubscribe, your profile remains up on their site. I have never successfully found a way to permanently remove my profile from their site. So, what does  do with all those non-active but not removed accounts?One thing they certainly do is give the impression that there are more \"active\" members on their site than there really are. I know they were part of a class action lawsuit pertaining to fake profiles, scammers, etc. that was dismissed. And I know that in an effort to reflect legitimate members,  has now added features where it shows if someone has read your message, and when the last time that \"someone\" was online. But how do we know that the person \"sitting behind\" the account that has recently been online is ACTUALLY the real person in the profile?My question is, does  use inactive member accounts to actively communicate with and deceive current members? Because from what I\\'m seeing, I think they may. Besides getting frequent messages from scammers and men WAY OUTSIDE of my age range (by 20-30 years!) here\\'s something I\\'m starting frequently seeing on my account.I see a man I\\'m interested in. I see that he\\'s been online in the past hour, couple of hours, twenty-four hours, etc. (so, I assume his is not a dormant account). I write him. The next day I see that he has read my message.

But when I\\'ve written over a dozen men in one week and I see the exact same pattern, it starts making me wonder. And it gets me thinking...Has  gone out and recovered/reactivated a ton of old deactivated accounts (unbeknownst to the original owner) and employed offshore people to sit around all day, logging into those accounts (to give the appearance that people are online), and read emails received from paying members (to give the impression that there is a mutual interest)? Because that\\'s what I\\'m starting to think.I\\'m not a model but am also not ugly. I\\'m 55 but have been told I look to be in my 40s. I\\'m 5\\'8\" and fit.

My profile is creative and thorough. I\\'m college educated, an empty-nester, fun, outgoing, etc. -- just like lots of other people. So, are there really just DOZENS of men on  who simply don\\'t have the manners to respond to an email with a simple, \"No thank you\"?I really think it\\'s a well-crafted scam to keep paying members interested. You see someone has read your email... you see they\\'ve been online recently... and your hopes are built up that you\\'ll get a reply. All to no avail.

After all how many family cars can accommodate a 5 feet tall, 150pound safe?..1 week later fedex ground delivers it, Box was a little battered but seemed intact so we accepted delivery. Had to open and remove box from safe to review contents, Only to discover no key. So I have a locked cabinet I cannot open. Called  customer service, guess what they won’t replace the key. Ok, I said return it. Ok they say, but it must be in a box to return it, I ask how do I do that? They say after escalating to their tier 2 sophisticated customer service, “that’s my problem, if I don’t b0x it, I cant return it”.. they cared nothing that they short shipped an order and charged me, they cared nothing that they could simply get me a key.. and they certainly cared nothing about customer service. If I couldtn’t Use something I got from them, they don’t care. It’s like about  policies. .... well, I’ll cancel the credit card payment and see them in small claims court before I get stuck with a gun safe I cannot open. My advice, don’t purchase anything that requires opening from .com, because if you want to return it they make you pack it all up again for shipping.

Within 2 months both batteries were failing to start the vehicles. Called WALMART CS about the issue. Told them the issue. Also told them that I was not wanting replacements because of the likelihood of having the same problem, and was going with a different/better brand. (Lesson learned) “All we can do is for you to bring both batteries in, and we’ll test them, and if they are bad.” (Setting the stage for the runaround) A Mechanic had already tested 1 of the batteries during reg servicing and said that the battery was bad without any input from us at all btw. I told WM Manager that I work 6-7 days per week, and very had very little free time, and that it would take some time before I could get into other place to get new Interstate batteries and get installed. I was just calling to let them know before the 90 days was up so to make sure that I could get a refund. “No problem, just bring them in as soon as you get the new batteries.” You can probably guess what happened next. The  circus began. After getting the typical song and dance routine from the original store, then from Corporate. Contacted another WM store in a more reputable area of town. Told them what was happening. “No problem, just bring them on in and we’ll test them, and give you a refund.” Nope. Took them in, and Manager quoted previously hooked the batteries up about 10 different ways (obviously having no clue how to work the machine) including hooking the opposite terminals up backwards at least twice. (We’re looking at one another and just backing away from idiot and machine at this point). Then another Manager walks by and says “What are you doing! You have them hooked up backwards!” Manager #1 in a panic in a panic at this point, then gets frustrated, turns around frustrated begins flopping battery#2 back into the cart and states “The tester says these batteries are good, but I can give you a free replacement.” I said no. We had prearranged that there would be a refund. Then she takes off into the back of the store. Long story short. I called WM Corporate back again, as I was talking to Corp. looked down and saw that the contents of one of the batteries was now visible on the outside of the battery. Corp. started to start the same song and dance, then after my telling about the leaked battery contents right there in front of CS desk, they finally conceded to contact the store. For over an hour no one at the store would answer the phone while Manager basically hid in the back, obviously hoping that the problem would go away. Their final solution? Place the leaked battery in a  PLASTIC BAG!!? And for us to take it home and wait for a return call that so far has never came. In order to point out the absurdity of all that had, and was continuing to take place, I asked both the WALMART store Manager, (who finally was called back out after we had to tell CS to answer the 3rd attempt from Corp to contact the store) and also asked Corporate \"Would WALMART advise an employee to place a battery that had been leaking into a  plastic shopping bag and place it into a confined/living/eating area where people were in?\" (Pointing out the (POISON) warning on top of the battery.)The fact that Management had been avoiding us for hours and no one answering the phone at the store speaks for itself. I also pointed out to Corp. There was even more absurdity, but the point is made here. I considered leaving the batteries there and abandoning them, along with the over $200 spent including core charges that I would have had been losing already through this little circus, or more like a carnival scam. But out of principle, and out of the possibility to hold someone accountable, I demanded that the Manager come back out, get me the bag that was recommended, and place the now having corrosive and “poisonous” leaked material on the outside into chosen by Manager) WALMART shopping bag, so we could return home with it.EVERYONE, including some of the WALMART employees who witnessed this ridiculous incident have urged me to file suit. I have never done that in my life, but I will give them the few \"business days\" that they claimed ‘Policy’ dictates to do what is right. My recommendation: Once you give a swindler your money, there are generally only 2 ways that you are going to get it back. Avoid all of this by not giving it to them to begin with. ’s tactics are becoming increasingly more deceptive, and aggressive toward/against their customers. Don’t become a victim and learn this lesson the hard way.\\n                    View more\\n                ', \"Original review: June 4, 2018With the exception of one customer service rep that was curt and condescending (I should have complained as I'm confident that they would have corrected it) they have gone above and beyond in resolving any issues with my online orders.

They had them delivered through a strange delivery company who had a problem finding my apartment (which has never happened with any other company I've dealt with). I called .com, the person I spoke with was confused and did not make any attempt to contact the delivery company. She gave me a number and sent another pair of watches, unrequested. I called the number, it was wrong. After considerable time online, I was able to get a number that worked and hashed out the problem with the delivery company. The watches came the next day. Then, another set of watches came from FedEx. I never ordered them, never signed for them. They were left unprotected at my doorstep that anyone could access. I brought the box inside and left it sitting there to await  to send someone to pick it up. After 18 days, they sent me an email saying they would charge me for the watches if I didn't send them back. This was a major inconvenience, given my work and the challenges around getting to FedEx where I live. When I spoke with a rep, she said that FedEx can pick up, but that I have to print an invoice (I don't own a printer), attach it to the box, call FedEx, arrange a pick-up time, give them the package, and call  back with an invoice number. This is all a serious hassle and they were not helpful in the least.

MARK PENDING ON SUCH LISTINGS!!', 'Let me start by saying to all the s that called in and complained about bogus leads and not being able to cancel, I understand your frustrations. Im no longer employed with them and I have been waiting MONTHS to write this review. This is by far the most unethical job I have ever encountered. I was told that I couldnt disclose certain policies and procedures to s that were spending loads of money on leads. Now I can speak freely. \\n\\nWhen you sign up for lead generation (zip codes) the Account Executives are going to fill your head up with lies because they want that sale. If they tell you that you will get 3-7 leads a month that is not true! 1 full share projects 40 leads a year. A half share is 20 in a year. \\n\\n The leads are not guaranteed. They will say they are. You are in a contract, they will say you can cancel anytime... that is not true! \\n\\nYou have a 3 day grace period, after that I guarantee you, your ability to cancel will be a nightmare! \\n\\nWhy? Because when you call customer care and you tell them you want to cancel youre going to be told youre in a contract. Youll say I didnt sign anything then they will say well I can start your cancellation request. Dont get too excited its just a nice way of saying, just because you asked doesnt mean it will happen. They will get you over to an account specialist. Which means youre going to get transferred to RETENTION thats if they can get a hold of someone over there. \\n\\nA multi billion dollar company and theres only 6 people in retention... so the likelihood of you speaking to someone is rare. Youll be told that they have 72 hours to call you back. \\n\\nMaybe youll get a call. Maybe you wont. \\n\\nYoull call back in furious. They will be empathetic and try to reach the person your case was assigned to. Youll be on hold long periods of time. I used to tell s that if you can spare time (which I know is rare) I can keep trying to reach them. I would be on a call for two hours trying to get a hold of them. Youll ask to speak to a manager. They cant help you. \\n\\nTheyll say we will get this escalated for you an escalation means that within 24 hours someone is supposed to call you back. Emphasis on supposed to. Remember there are only 6 people in the retention department. \\n\\nYoull try to remove your card by calling in. They wont let you. You can cancel your card on file which is a headache in itself because now you have to call all the other places that had your card number and let them know you have a new card. \\n\\nYou can call in with your credit card company. This will not help you if they cant get you transferred to retention. \\n\\nTheres no point in asking your account executive to cancel it for you. They dont have the ability and you will get the run around. Thats if you can even get a response from them. Account executives are rude and have absolutely no professionalism. Not the ones I talked to in the 4 months I worked there. Quick to take your money but after that? You are ignored. \\n\\nLead generation is a gamble. Are some people successful from it yes. Are all people? No. You will get spam leads. You will get a bunch of leads from other s asking you how the program works. This will count against your leads. \\n\\nAccount Executives will tell you that they will make up the bad leads. THIS IS A LIE!!!! You will very rarely get a credit. \\n\\nIf you are looking to cancel remember you only have 3 days to do so. They have shared leads that rotate between two other agents or unshared leads. Fast is shared leads. Flex is unshared. Remember that if you so desire to get zip codes. \\n\\nMy advice get a prepaid credit card and dont give them a back up card number at all. \\n\\nThe only product that I ever recommended was advantage so that your listings are protected. If you have a listing on RDC and you dont have advantage you wont get the lead. Someone else will. \\n\\nThe best feature you can use is the free dashboard on RDC. Create your profiles, add your NRDS ID numbers (if you have them) network by getting reviews and recommendations. You can utilize the dashboard by updating listing photos or adding open houses if it doesnt or didnt pull over from the MLS. \\n\\nListing issues: the resolution department can take up to 72 hours to resolve your issues. Due to the new updates on the dashboard (realsuite) there are more glitches on the site and there are a lot of issues with the MLSs that are unable to syndicate properly on the sight. Countless emails are sent to employees every day about something not working. \\n\\nThis pretty much is my tell all review about what to expect when you call in. This call center has a very high turnover rate. Higher than most. \\n\\nTheres a reason why there are class action lawsuits against them. Everything in the class action is correct. \\n\\nLastly customer care reps are very limited in what they can do. Customer care reps cant cancel. Cant make changes to your listings. You get transferred to another department for credit card updates. Customer care reps can help you with your dashboard and mapping issues and putting in cases. Please keep in mind to get an escalation on a case 72 business hours must have passed. \\n\\nI sincerely hope this helps someone and can perhaps spare you a long hold time or a phone call. \\n\\nShould you have questions Ill gladly answer.', \"This site manipulates data.

They'll publish and lowball the number, but the buyers take it as gospel.

We signed up for rental of our former Dahlonega home early in 2017, after losing several months due to one of their agents having an accident of which we were never informed until those vital months were lost.  We never got the full monthly rental amount  we were told to expect, which seemed to be used to lure our business -- and then dropped. CRE-CPM pressed us to rent to college students and others whom we felt would be undependable as to paying rent properly and caring for our house.  Finally, they found a father-son team to whom we agreed to rent; but when the father died suddenly, CRE-CPM absolutely refused to re-write the lease to include only the son, which was likely an invalid lease causing our tenant to believe he could just stop paying rent -- which is just what he did, costing us thousands of dollars while he remained in our house. Meanwhile, their monthly rental statements were often in error.\\n\\nThen, our CRE-CPM rental agent told us to evict him -- but she also told our tenant he was being evicted, which we had never authorized her to do, causing him to send us nasty emails claiming to justify his non-payment of rent. Then, our rental agent told us to cancel the eviction, which we did after paying for it -- but the damage was done. Our tenant stopped paying any rent at all, and CRE-CPM'S feeble efforts to collect it helped lead to his damaging our home and its contents (we had rented it furnished.)  Meanwhile, CRE-CPM broke our property management agreement by doing a repair at double the allowed cost for unapproved repairs -- while not bothering to check if the former work was under warranty. Our original CRE-CPM rental agent was removed by the firm's owner around then.\\n\\n After our tenant left, apparently taking some of our items, the owner of CRE-CPM claimed he had supervised the tenant's move -- but it turned out he had not even noted items which were missing or damaged, per our complete set of photos of our home prior to tenancy, photos in CRE-CPM's possession. Finally, when we asked that same owner to honor the balance of our property management agreement by re-renting the house, as he promised to do: no serious effort was ever made, not even a FOR RENT sign at the property, and no showings or advertisements or open-houses.  When we complained about CRE-CPM's failure to honor the balance of our property management agreement, that same owner immediately got a lawyer who threatened us if we took any legal action.  So, we lost thousands more rent dollars due to the firm owner's failure to make a promised serious effort to re-rent our property.\\n\\nFinally, in desperation, we decided to sell our  property, rather than risk another such horrendous rental experience.\\r\\n{This is merely a summary of our own personal experience with CRE-CPM; make your own decision, but do beware!}\", 'My husband and I have bought and sold close to 20 homes in our life time.
